Maybe give us some more information about your hardware.

If you happen to be using an S3 Savage graphics card (as used in
the IBM Thinkpad T20 and probably others) and you get strange display
problems plus the freezing problem then set this environment variable:
  SAL_DO_NOT_USE_INVERT50=true
You will need this environment variable set when running soffice,
so you should add an export line to your .bashrc.

Hope this helps,

David
