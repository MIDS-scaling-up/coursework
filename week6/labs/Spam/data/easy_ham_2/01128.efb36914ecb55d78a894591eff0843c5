i took a look into the repository it "just" contains gstreamer and his dependecies
but thats nice for people who use it though :)

thanks,
che

personally i am capped to 16 kb/s upstream only :\ if i just had like 10 to 20 times of that i would run a repository for sure. i guess alot of people would love to even get daily builds (yes i know i deserve to be eaten for that idea because it would need alot of bandwidth) but well would still be nice :).
