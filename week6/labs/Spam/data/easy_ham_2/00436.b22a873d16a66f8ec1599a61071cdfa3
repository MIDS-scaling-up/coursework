Hey there,
Im using the standard ADSL package
With the speedtouch usb modem

I have a 3 machine network(it was a 4 machine till my laptop crapped out)
Anyway
I have a dedicated linux server running debian 3.0 with the ADSL modem
plugged directly into it.
I have a 5 port switch connecting the home net, all have their own 10/100 nic.
The server runs my firewall/net gateway/etc.
And I have some firewall rules for masquerading 
which shares the connection over the lan just nicely.

Once the machine is configured for adsl  (thats the tough bit)
the network stuff is quite easy.

I found that to be the simpelst way to go.
