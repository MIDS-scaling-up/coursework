Well, from the looks of things, I can import all my mail settings from
Evolution to Sylpheed.  Has anyone successfully run Sylpheed in Gnome
2.0?  I noticed with 'apt-get install gnome-session' from the 'rpm
http://apt.sunnmore.net gnome2 73' repository, Sylpheed isn't one of the
packages selected for deletion.

Sub : Monitoring su attempts                         LOST #115

In a multiuser system you may like to monitor all su attempts.
Edit /etc/login.defs and edit SULOG_FILE as follows:
SULOG_FILE    /var/log/sulog   ... (name of file to hold info)
