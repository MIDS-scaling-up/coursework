    Yep.  Make sure there's a field in the database called (for example) "Updated" and when it comes time to generate the list, add "order by updated".  This'll put it in that particular order for ya.  You can also chose to order it by name, etc by changing this field.

    This should be the same for both MySql and Postgressql (any modern SQL, really).  Which are you using?
