Sean Connery was interviewed by Michael Parkinson, and bragged that
despite his 72 years of age, he could still have sex three times a
night.

Lulu, who was also a guest, looked intrigued.

After the show, Lulu said, "Sean, if Ah'm no bein too forward, Ah'd love
tae hae sex wi an aulder man. Let's go back tae mah place."

So they go back to her place and have great sex. Afterwards, Sean  says,
"If you think that was good, let me shleep for half an hour, and we can
have even better shex. But while I'm shleeping, hold my baws in your
left hand and my wullie in your right hand."

Lulu looks a bit perplexed, but says, "Okay."

He sleeps for half and hour, awakens, and they have even better sex.
Then Sean says, "Lulu,  that was wonderful. But if you let me shleep
for an hour, we can have  the besht shex yet. But again, hold my baws
in your left hand, and my wullie in your right hand."

Lulu is now used to the routine and  complies.

The results are mind blowing. Once it's all over, and the cigarettes
are lit, Lulu asks "Sean, tell me, dis mah haudin yer baws in mah left
hand and yer wullie in mah right stimulate ye while ye're sleepin?"

Sean replies, "No, but the lasht time I shlept with a Glashwegian, she
shtole my wallet."
