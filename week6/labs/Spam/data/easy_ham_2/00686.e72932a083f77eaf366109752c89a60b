I can tell you what the 'clear' and 'del' arguments mean:

Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k clear cur {} public
	This means to clear the 'cur' sequence for lists/l-k

Mh_SequenceUpdate lists/l-k del unseen 5400 public
	This means to delete message 5400 from the 'unseen' sequence for lists/l-k

Can you explain more what you were actually doing as this occurred?  This 
doesn't appear to be background processing.  Is there significance to message 
5400?  Is it the one that isn't displaying?

Chris
