Surely it would be faster to save you conf files, install it on the box
again, copy back you confs and voila.
All you car about are the confs as the boite has no DATA right?

Thats what I would do, but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult &
complicated as possible ;--)

Have you thought about mirroring the system drives? Might save you serious
hassle down the line. 

Only kidding but thats what I would do.

OK, Here's how to do it [1] ...

While the disk is still installed in the i686 machine (if that's broken,
beg, borrow or steal...), remove the i686 versions of glibc and kernel and
install the i386 versions.  This will break one or two other packages since
they have entries in /etc/ld.so.conf which belongs to glibc.  these packages
will need to be reinstalled.  So:

1. rpm -e --nodeps glibc

	Your /etc/ld.so.conf has been saved as /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave

2. rpm -ivh glibc-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
3. rpm -e --nodeps kernel
4. rpm -ivh kernel-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

This installs the i386 versions of kernel and glibc.  You'll be able to boot
in a non 686 machine now.  However, X is now broken as is kerberos.  At
least those are the two I noticed.  Your /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave will
contain clues as to what else might be broken.  To fix X and kerberos you
need to reinstall their libs (copying /etc/ld.so.conf.rpmsave back to
/etc/ld.so.conf doesn't seem to work):

1. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs XFree86-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm
2. rpm -ivh --replacepkgs krb5-libs-<v.e.r-no>-i386.rpm

fixes them.  Other libs listed in _my_ /etc/ld.so.conf are qt, mysql and
sane.  If they start behaving in odd fashions, it may be related.
Reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that.

Thanks guys...

Since this thing will be on a sub 56k dialup, any remote admin will be
strictly of the emergency variety.  I plan to have the server mail me its
logs and stuff regurlarly so I can keep an eye on it but most/all of the
admin will be done locally.

[1] "it" being migrate a Hard Disk from an Intel P3/4/celeron box to an AMD
K6-x box.  Essentially, the P3/4/celeron processor is an i686 class while
the AMD K6 processor is an i586 class (not sure about the AMD athlon or
duron chips).  A RHL installed on the i686 class machine will not boot on an
i586 calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i686.  The
solution is to replace the i686 kernel and glibc with i386 versions.
