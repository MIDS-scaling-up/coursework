I flag spam at 7.0 and drop it altogether at 20.0. I do lots of whitelisting
and have never had a false positive over 20.0.

Actually I save the 20-and-over spams to a file and occasionally
double-check it.

This allows me to keep over 75% of the spam out of my mailbox entirely - I
have 3-4 messages a day in my Spam folder instead of 20-30.

My system doesn't allow me to bounce messages with SA, but doing so doesn't
really get anybody removed from spam lists anyway... I have addresses that
have been bouncing for years that still get spam.
