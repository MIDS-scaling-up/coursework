Let's take a look at an example here. Someone on this list signed
razor-users@fsckit.net up to a ZDNet mailing list that doesn't confirm
subscriptions in a piss-poor attempt to mailbomb me. I report all of these
mailings to Razor because, guess what, for me this is spam. This and a
hundred more traditional spam emails to automated spamtrap addresses get 
reported by me daily. I probably have a decent TES value because of all of
this.

Now lets say someone else who is also reporting a fair amount of your
typical proxy/relayed spam has been reporting these and has built up a
decent TES rating because of it. However they subscribed to that same ZDNet
list and enjoy getting the mail from it except that they don't like seeing 
it tagged as spam by Razor. So they razor-revoke it. 

Who loses in this case? Why? Neither party is inaccurate in their actions
IMO. But someone's standing is going to get hurt because of it.
