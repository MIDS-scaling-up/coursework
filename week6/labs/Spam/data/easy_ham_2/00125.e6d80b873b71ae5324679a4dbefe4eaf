sort of. Squid, and most other good http proxies won't let you connect
to any other destination port other than 443 (by default).  So the sshd 
has to be listening on port 443. PuTTy's proxy support is a bit flaky 
right now, the raw connects are a bit flaky aswell, I can't get them 
to work with certain revisions of IOS becuase they use different prompts
and success strings, gah! I havnt played with the SOCKS proxy support
much yet, but it's there.

If you're trying to SSH through a http proxy, use netcat :)
PuTTy's proxy stuff will take another few weeks to get stable, and
currently it won't send keepalives, so if you go afk expect your 
session to get killed by the proxy.  Netcat send keepalives
which prevent this :)

# 
# call as http_proxy_tunnel host port
#
function http_proxy_tunnel()
{
	mkfifo in.fifo

	( echo CONNECT $1:$2 HTTP/1.1 
          echo HOST: $1:$2
          echo HTTP/1.1
	  echo 
          cat in.fifo ) | nc myproxy 3128 | (read ; read ; nc -lp <localport> > in.fifo )
}


course that assumes you have bash, I use cygwin, but the above should be
doable natively, then again if you have cygwin, use OpenSSH and it's
excellently configurable proxycmd :)
