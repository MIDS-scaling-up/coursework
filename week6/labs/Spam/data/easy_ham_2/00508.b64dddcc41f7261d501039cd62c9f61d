I had Apache, mod_php and MySQL running on windows 95 once :)

As far as I remember, the only problem was getting the MSI installer installed
on win 95, but that was mentioned in the docs. w2k has that built in, so you
won't have that problem. You should be able to find pre-built binaries for 
win32.

For perl try activestate.com, that's worked for me in the past.
