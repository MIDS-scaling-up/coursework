Yo Mark,

Have you goten the closed source drivers from Nvidia or are you still using
the wans that came with Redbum? 

http://www.nvidia.com and then somewhere...somwhere-else...

Installation is WELL detailed, you should see the NV splash screen, don;t
forget to edit the config files.

Hi

I have just installed Red Hat 7.2 on my desktop machine. I am completely new
to Linux and therefore have run into a few problems.

The graphic display on my PC doesnt seem to work. My monitor is slightly
miss-aligned and I cannot run any high resolution games ( everything freezes
). In the hardware browser in Gnome it lists my Graphics Card (Riva TNT2),
and shows installed drivers...... maybe the problem lies elswhere.

Another problem I have is that I cannot install my ISDN, USB modem ( LASAT
Speed Basic ), however im pretty sure its not supported by Linux, but again
it is featured in the Hardware Browser, without installed drivers.

If anybody has any ideas, please let me know cos id like to use Linux more.
Please keep in mind I am new to it though.

Thanks

Mark
