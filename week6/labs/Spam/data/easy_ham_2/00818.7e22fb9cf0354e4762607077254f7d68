Wait... I didn't think we had any filters set up on FoRK.
Kragen, do you know of any?

I personally have FoRK delivered to an address (napier%waste.org)
that has SpamAssassin enabled, agressively, where it just nukes
anything it thinks is spam. Usually I figure if I miss a FoRK post,
no big deal, I'll pick it up by the replies if it's interesting.

For personal mail (joe%barrera.org) I either don't use SpamAssassin,
or use it but where it just flags messages instead of nuking them.
So if someone is sending a message just to me, I'll get it even
if it looks like spam.

So in other words, Rohit, if you had sent to joe%barrera.org, I
guess I would have received it in a timely fashion.

So where's all that booze? When's the retry?
Every robust protocol needs a retry strategy --
what's yours?
