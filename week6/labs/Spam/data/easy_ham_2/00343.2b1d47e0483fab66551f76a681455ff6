I'm confused. I thought it was GPL'ed and
that the money you paid SuSE was for your
60 day support or whatever? 

I don't particularly need support, so I'm not 
really interested in purchasing a set of disks 
with 4 billion apps which I'll never use.

Yes, thanks for your input. Anyway, I've a friend
with 7.3 pro, so I'll just ask him.
