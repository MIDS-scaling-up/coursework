    I was thinkinf about an addition of another file: apt-repositories. Stick it on apt.freshmeat.net (the center of the apt universe, IMHO) and every time a new repository is added, the RPM can be rebuilt.  Heck, if I could get out of my depression, I could make the whole submission process automated....even making the RPM...
