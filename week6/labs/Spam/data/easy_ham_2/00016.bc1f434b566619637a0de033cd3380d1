Hi all, I posted the below question to this list so I thought I'd update you
all. Thanks for your suggestions.

Well, I'd decided to bite the bullet and spend big on a new case and CPU
fan.

I bought a lian-li aluminum case. It was expensive as cases go (stg£133.86)
but I decided, it's a good basis to build any future PC on.
It has 4 x 51/4" drive bays and 6 x 3½" drive bays so I should be ok for
future upgrades etc. I have to say it was worth it. Its a pleasure to work
on. It has a slide out tray to mount the Mother Board on, both sides come
off, the drive bays come out...all without using a screwdriver (thumb
screws). Even the edges inside the case are smooth so no banging your hands
off shape edges etc. There are 4 fans inside the case, which can be set to 3
different speeds. There are 4 usb ports on the front of the box too. The box
is big and has loads of room inside.
Oh... and it looks very cool :-)

However there are 2 things to look out for. On the Maplins website it says

* Up to three 80mm case fans can be fitted!
* ATX Power supply sold separately

In fact the case came with 4 fans and a power supply, which is great but I
ordered 2 fans and a power supply separately.
Also the case was a slightly different model to one advertised, as I got the
USB model. It does say (Product may vary in design and specification from
that show) but I missed that :-)

I also bought a Flower Cooler Kit which is completely silent. Very nice.
(thanks Mike)

So now I can code-in-peace...

Justin
