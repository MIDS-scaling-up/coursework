Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?

  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.

I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.

  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nu

However to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.

What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.

  eg I'm currently in folder:

    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L

    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.

  Similarly when in folder:

    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L

  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nu

That way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.

Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...
