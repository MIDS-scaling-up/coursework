Seems also from the news being reported that it's likely they already
have a slice of that pie, which says something about the mindset of
the people handing out the slices.  Ditto for the biometric airport ID
machines.

My personal raw guess: The people with the pie /already/ /know/ the
people with the Ghostbusters Gear, they play golf regularly, have for
years, and perhaps even co-own some private venture that profits win
or lose from the grant.  9-11 seems to have made every
security-oriented-corp shareholder's eyes light up with
red-white-and-blue dollar signs, and like sharks to a cut swimmer or
psychologists to a distressed town, they came swarming on the
motherlode.

I only guess that because the pattern seems historically so
statistically prevalent.
