[last message before I unsub]

It's a very poor comparison.

There is no question as to what Ebay's trust model is. It's
completely transparent. The ratings and the feedback is there for all to
see. Most importantly it relies on the individual to make the decision for
themselves rather or not to trust a buyer/seller.

Contrast this with TeS which utilizes "sooper secret" methodologies to
determine rather or not a submitter is trusted or not and at what point
something becomes spam at some level of "confidence."

The unfortunate thing is that in my experience Razor is an incredibly
ineffective filter at this point. The spot checking I've done indicates about
a 40% hit rate. Submissions I made a week ago still don't count as spam,
apparently because I'm not trusted enough, or enough people haven't submitted
the item, or some unknown combination thereof. Why anyone would continue to
waste their time submitting items when they aren't being accepted due to
a series of calculations which will not be shared is beyond me.

Any trust model that cannot survive public scrutiny isn't worth trusting IMHO.
