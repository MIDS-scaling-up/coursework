    I'm in your same shoes- I can get it upgraded and all, but I can never seem to work out where to start out with the thing; it strikes me as confusing!  But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It's just not EASY yet.  I'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  And the docs are complete, too...
