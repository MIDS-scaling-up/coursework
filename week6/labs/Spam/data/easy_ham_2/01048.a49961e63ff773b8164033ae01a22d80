Subject: Re: Al Qaeda's Fantasy Ideology


Youre right of course - the attack was performed for its effect on
muslims, not for its effect on the US. By showing that it can be done,
they inspire others to follow in their path, or so they hope.

I take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy, because it
is somewhat perjorative. Imagining different worlds can often lead the
world to become more like that imagined. Moreso if action is taken on
the basis of those imaginings.

Theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that
anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck.
This is equally a fantasy, but one made to approach reality through
consensus.

An interesting question then becomes, if Al Queda's actions are in
furtherance of a fantasy, what fantasies are George Bush's actions in
furtherace of? How many of the actions of George Bush and the US are
performed for their effect on the US population? For example, how much
showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street. Is
this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices Al Queda made?

What cultural myopia is in play here in the US?

I make a point of reading Australian, Britsish and US news. Today I
noticed that the Australian and British news are featuring the Iraqi
overtures to the UN on inspectors, while US news is featuring Iraqi war
preparations (digging bunkers etc).

At a time that the US is withdrawing from international cooperation on
multiple levels, the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies (invisible
preferably) is somewhat appealing. A self fullfilling prophesy, if you
like. Perhaps that's whats at work here.
