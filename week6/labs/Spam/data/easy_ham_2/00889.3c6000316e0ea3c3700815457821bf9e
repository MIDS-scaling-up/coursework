Or perhaps it is the unregulated and out of control capitalism used as a
tool to concentrate wealth and form a greed-based society?

I notice the top 5 have a good amount of socialism in their systems to
regulate the capitalism, especially in things like health care and
education.

Just look at our health care - no insurance = no care. Or education - gimme
my voucher so I can get my kids out of the system while their IQ is still
over 20.

South American countries are currently figuring out just where this
greed-based system ends up, and are looking for a way out.

It was a fun ride tho wasnt it?
