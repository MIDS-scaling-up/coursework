Subject: [ILUG] Anyone know how I could remove a HDD password from an Acer Travelmate 201T?

Hi folks,

I have just taken delivery of three Acer Travelmate laptops from a project
we funded which has now ended.  Problem is there are HDD passwords on them
which I don't have.  How could I overwrite these?? Any ideas?  I have
limited technical and monetry resources here in the new job so can't be
buying new HDDs for them.

Any Ideas?

Dave
