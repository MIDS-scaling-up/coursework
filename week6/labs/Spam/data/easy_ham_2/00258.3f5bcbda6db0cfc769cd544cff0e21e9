Yea, I tried the VESA driver but it doesn't seem to want to work,
it's kinda weird actually, when I run Xconfigurator, the test 
comes up ok sometimes but when I try to load X it won't come
up at all.

I read the intel page, I think I'll just throw this on the back burner
until intel bring out a driver for this.

Thanks for your help though.
