I'm not knocking dell in general, my next machine is going to be a dell. But
buying a
random dell box is likely to result in much tearing out of hair.

The onboard DVMT card has an Intel 845 G/GL chipset.
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/linux/ or
http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/intel845g/linux.htm has more specific
information. There is help available there.

I also found somewhere (not through personal experience though) that
2.4.19-pre10ac2 includes drivers for the chipset ?
