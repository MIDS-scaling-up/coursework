Jepp. The same is true for Justin's private page jmason.org. traceroutes to 
both these servers die at the same point:

There're probably some problems with Justin's webserver; I'm shure he's 
already looking into this as it affects his own website, too :o)

spamassassin.sf.net is the US mirror, also accessible through 
us.spamassassin.org.

For me it worked until yesterday or the day before.

About this question: No, that's currently not possible. But I was thinking 
about implementing a feature like this; it might be in the next release.
