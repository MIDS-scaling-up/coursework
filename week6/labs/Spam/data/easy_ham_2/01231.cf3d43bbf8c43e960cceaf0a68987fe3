Hmm.  1. The quote is not suggesting that people use './configure'.
2. The quote is not saying that rpm will _try_ to eval macros even
if the user forgot to pass the leading '%'.  It is saying the opposite:
rpm will try to support users who "forgot" to _leave off_ the leading
'%'.  That is what the documentation _says_, but rpm does not follow
the documentation.  If you leave off the '%', then rpm will not eval
the macro, at least for rpm 4.0.4.

Confused?

Anyway, back to my original problem: what about documentation for
the macros '%post', '%postun', and '%files'?  Here's some of what
I found "documented" in the the CHANGES file that 'rpm' includes:

Line 46:
	- macro for %files, always include %defattr(), redhat config
only.

Line 49:
	- bail on %files macro.

Hmm.  So, there is no %files macro?

Line 172-174:
	- add "rpmlib(ScriptletInterpreterArgs)" to track
	    %post -p "/sbin/ldconfig -n /usr/lib"
	  incompatibilities.

I'm unable to find a corresponding description for %postun, but it
appears to work just the same.  The important things to remember are:

  1. Don't forget the double-quotes around the -p argument string.  If
     you leave them off, you'll get the cryptic error message:

     error: line #: Package does not exist: %post -p /sbin/ldconfig -n
/usr/lib

  2. This only works with RPM 4.0.3 or later.
