Hi all --

We had a pretty serious crash on the list host over the weekend, and it
destroyed all configuration data.  As a result, I've had to rebuild the
mailing list from various other sources -- including the archives of
past list traffic.

If you're a list subscriber, you may have received a "welcome to the list"
mail. All well and good.  However, if you *used* to be subscribed to one 
of the lists at some point in 2002, or never were (I'm hoping that didn't
happen!), you may have also have received one of these.  Just go to the
URL and click "unsubscribe", providing the password from the mail if
necessary.

If you're a list admin on any of the lists at lists.boxhost.net or
taint.org, I'd appreciate if you could take a look and make sure the
settings match up with what they used to be.

Sorry about this :(

--j.
