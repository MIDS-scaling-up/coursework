PlayStation owners win copyright case

Owners of PlayStation consoles who modify their machines to play games
bought overseas have had a win in the Federal Court.

Sony Computer Entertainment has failed in its claim that "chipping" breaks
copyright laws.

Sony launched legal proceedings against a Sydney man, Eddy Stevens, for
allegedly selling pirated games and also providing and installing
modification chips.

PlayStation consoles in Australia are different from those in the US and
Japan because of the different television formats.

The court was told "chipping" allows people to play legitimately bought
overseas games and copies of games, but also pirated games.

The judgement by Federal Court Justice Ronald Sackville says Sony failed
to prove that PlayStation consoles have a copyright protection measure
installed in the first place and therefore could not rule that a mod chip
breaks copyright legislation.

Mr Stevens was found to have infringed trademark rules in relation to the
pirated games he sold a matter which will come before the court again next
month.
