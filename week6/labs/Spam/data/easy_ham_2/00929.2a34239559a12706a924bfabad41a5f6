One scam to rule them all,
One scam to bind them, 
One scan to burn them all, 
And the stupidity bind them. 

(Yes, i'm ripping, and badly from LOTR) 

Alright, so NPR's All Things Considered had a wonderful story on the whole Nigerian 419 scams that seem to be running
into my inbox constantly (Thanks FoRK!) Turns out, these 419 scams (419 is the statute in Nigeria that this particular form
of fraud falls under) have actually snared a few people -- NPR reported to the tune of 100 million dollars over a few years, in the US alone.

One website listed the 419 scam as being the 'third to fith largest industry in Nigeria' (1), netting billions of dollars
from around the world.   Its large enough to warrant a governmental investigation and a special number to call and report
(to the secret service, no less) scam abuse. (2)   Folks are apparently being held for ransom if they decide to go
'check out' the scam.  (3).

Listen to the NPR article (4).   What's great about NPR is the commentary at the end. Turns out, this is all unbelievably
common.   The origination, at least to NPR's knowledge, starts with the scam elements being transposed from Nigeria,
to London, England.   Instead of the bereved widow of a Nigerian national, the originating con was directed to the 'heirs'
of Sir Frances Drake's estate.   If you were 'chosen' as an heir, you could contribute a portion of your money so that a
fellow heir (and scam artist) could reclaim the monetary largess in the Court of England, by proving that Elizabeth I had
nulled Sir Drake's will and taken his fortune as her own.   Oscar
Hartzell, the gent who started this scam, way back in the early 1800s,
managed to gain quite a fortune, all on the backs of idiots.   Sound familiar?

A fool and his money, deserve to be parted.

(202) 406-5031.'  From:  http://www.secretservice.gov/alert419.shtml  --
They also have a number for those idiots who have lost their money to this.

So i'm in a wierd mood, go figure.
