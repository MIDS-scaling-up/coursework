Xander Blakley quotes a Russian joke in his terrific book _Siberia Bound_. 
Frenchman, American, and Russian get to talking bout which country has the 
more desireable women. Frenchman says, "Ah, when a Frenchman puts his hands 
around zee waist of his lover, his fingers form a complete circle and 
touch--not because his hands are so large, but because zee  French woman's 
waist is so slender."
    American says "Yep, but when an American woman gets on a horse, her heels 
reach all the way down to the ground--and it's not because American horses 
are short, but because American women have such endlessly long, sexy legs."
    Russian says: "Da, but when a Russian slaps his wife's ass on his way out 
of the house in the morning, it's still jiggling when he comes back after 
work--and it's not because her ass is so big, but because the Russian work 
day is so short."
