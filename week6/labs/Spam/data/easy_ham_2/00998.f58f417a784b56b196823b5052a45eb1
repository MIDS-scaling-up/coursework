If you crypto-sign your outgoing mail, you don't have to set 
your mailwall whitelist to accept unsigned mail spoofed as being 
from you. 

Similarly, if you include some weaker token or checksum that
spammers can't easily guess. 

If you can track the actual sender, then the proof that they've
committed identity fraud is your credible testimony that you
are the rightful user of the declared originating address, and
that you did not send the message. I'm not sure what level of
damages you could claim, though.
