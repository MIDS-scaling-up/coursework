[this mail is automatically generated by the 'vacation' program]

I will not be reading my mail for a while -- in fact, I will be reading my mail
very intermittently until June, as I'm travelling around the world.
Your mail regarding "Immediately Attract Women          .                PVWPJ" will be read at that point.

If you're writing about something NetNote-related, please contact Nicola
McDonnell <nicola@netnoteinc.com>.  

SpamAssassin-related contact should be directed to the SpamAssassin-talk
mailing list <spamassassin-talk@lists.sf.net>, or to Craig Hughes
<craig@hughes-family.org>.

Sitescooper-related mail should go to <sitescooper-talk@lists.sf.net>.
WebMake-related stuff goes to, you guessed it, <webmake-talk@lists.sf.net> ;)

I will (probably) read your mail eventually... but it will take a while.
See you in June!
