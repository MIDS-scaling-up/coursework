> CHICAGO, July 25 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com releases details on four more 

stocks that are part of their exclusive list of Stocks to Sell Now. These 

stocks are currently rated as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). These stocks have 

been proven to under-perform the S&P 500 by 89.8% since its inception in 1980. 

While the rest of Wall Street continued to tout stocks during the market declines 

of the last few years, we were telling our customers which stocks to sell in order 

to save themselves the misery of unrelenting losses. Among the #5 ranked stocks today 

we highlight the following companies: Dynegy, Inc. (NYSE:DYN) and Manugistics Group, Inc.
