This is called "pseudo-packages" or "meta-packages" and Debian has been
using them for ages. I think Mandrake also makes these kind of empty
packages.

Anyway, their use has been discussed here a while back, and personally
although I do agree that they can be useful at times, I don't really like
them. For me it's more of an ugly "hack" than anything else, and I'd
approve completely a system that would enable to install/remove entire
categories of software... but not if achieved by building empty packages.

Also, you can trivially do "apt-get install <metapackage>", but removing
all that it installed is a bit less trivial, and could be implemented in a
trivial and clean fashion if using some functionality meant to do this.
