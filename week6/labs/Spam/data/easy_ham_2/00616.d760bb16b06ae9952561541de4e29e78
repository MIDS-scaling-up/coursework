I'm talking specifically about the last ~24 hours where it seems 
like things have not been working.  People who've been using the 
Outlook plugin have been telling me they've been seeing really 
bad performance, which I've been attributing to the problems 
which have been discussed here and on sa-talk.  I'm not saying 
it's completely not working, or that it has no chance of being 
fixed 15 minutes from now, just that it's not currently working, 
and there have been a number of "hiccup" periods in the last 
couple months.  Plus, it's hard to deny that we don't know yet 
if the trust network is going to work or not -- it only just got 
switched on, and that changeover seems to have corresponded with 
people noticing things have stopped working right.
