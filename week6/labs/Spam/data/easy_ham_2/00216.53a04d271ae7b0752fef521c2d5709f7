Hi Niall,

Some thoughts...

o Run the ssh client with verbosity 3 (ssh -v -v -v)
o Run an sshd with debugging level three (sshd -d -d -d)
o ~alfio doesn't seem to be nfs-mounted like ~alfred

(The following aren't really applicable, but...
    o Has alfred been logged in for ages? Has the tmpsweeper swept
      through /tmp removing alfred's ssh-agent directory in its wake?
    o Is /tmp a+rwxt? Does /dev/null exist?
    o Has alfred been messing with his TMPDIR envar?
    o What does lsof on his ssh-agent say? What about on alfio's?
    o What are the permissions on ~alfred and ~alfred/.ssh?
    o Does alfred's uid conflict with somebody else's?
    o Does alfred's $SSH_AGENT_PID correspond to his agent? alfio's?
)

Wesley.
