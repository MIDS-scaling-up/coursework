(1) Quibble:  For values of "work" limited to X11, not console support.

(2) Decent substitute graphics cards with well-tested XFree86 support
are cheap.  Swap the problematic one out, and save it for some other
workstation later.  For that matter, somebody with a Win32 system
containing such a card might be ecstatic over the opportunity to swap.

(3) Welcome to the Linux world, where we've known for... oh... about
eleven years that you fail to research chipsets before installation at
your peril.
