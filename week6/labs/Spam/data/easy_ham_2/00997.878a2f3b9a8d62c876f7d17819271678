There are several issues here.

(1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
commercial advertising, we need email software that
prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
simply can't continue down the path where every
script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
damage.

(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
point that digital signatures are the standard way
to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
your machine or otherwise compromising your private
key will be the only way that someone can forge a
message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.

(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says "I'm George
Bush" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.
