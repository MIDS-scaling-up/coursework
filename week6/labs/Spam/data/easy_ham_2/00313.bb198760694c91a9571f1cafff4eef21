Hi all,

I have a debian machine with an external ISDN terminal adapter, which 
I'm trying to get to dial a Cisco 3600 running CHAP. wvdial on Red Hat 
copes fine with this. However, I get the same results if i use pon or 
wvdial on Debian: pppd negotiation is detected, pppd is started -- and 
I'm never assigned an IP address.

Looking at the logs on the Cisco, I see that in place of the username I 
seem to be transmitting a six-digit hex number. e.g.:

Aug  8 23:35:00.311 UTC+1: %ISDN-6-CONNECT: Interface Serial0/0:19 is 
now connected to <phonenum> 19eb85

The last entry should be my dialup username. (Substitute incoming phone 
number for <phonenum>).

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Cheers,
Dave
