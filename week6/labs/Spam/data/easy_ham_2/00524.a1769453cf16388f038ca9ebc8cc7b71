Hi Lee,

+ You could try iewebs.com aswell, though I don't know if they do
+ "just hosting".
+
Heh, you won't find much on iewebs.com these days. Apache test page.

For future reference, ieWebs is /kind of/ defunct -- I won't be able to do
private devel projects for a while, so I'm not actively pushing it. I still
do hosting and domreg, but I only do vanilla accounts unless I know the user
reasonably well. I have trust issues.

Thanks for the plug though. Just like me to no longer have a website when it
happens. :)

adam
