I found the following mentioned on a news.gnome.org usenet posting. 
I've not yet tried it thou.  AFAIK this is just the gnome2 rpms, but
there ximian's, don't know what else is on the apt repository either,
must take a look around.

# Gnome2 - mentioned on news.gnome.org
rpm http://apt.sunnmore.net/ gnome2 gnome2
