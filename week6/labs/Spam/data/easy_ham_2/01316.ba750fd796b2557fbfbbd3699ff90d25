people from the world of Perl."

[0]Dan writes "One of the many things that's come out of this year's TPC
is the appointment of a new Pumpking. No, not Hugo van der Sanden, who
hopefully everyone knows is taking on the task of 5.9 and 5.10. No, I'm
talking about the inimitable Michael Schwern, who's now holder of the
perl 1 pumpkin and, I'm assured, is well on the way to a new maintenance
release. Details are over on [1]dev.perl.org. Join the porters list and
help Schwern out!" Yes, he said "perl 1".
