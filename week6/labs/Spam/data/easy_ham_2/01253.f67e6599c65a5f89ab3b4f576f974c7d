I realize this is an old thread, but I just had to comment:

A lot of C++ programmers, myself included, were /not/ complaining about 
gcc's stricter adherence to the specification (which, by the way, a lot 
of kernel programmers complain about with gcc 3.x -- at least, the 
patch authors I've talked to hate gcc 3) -- gcc "2.96" had a lot of 
bugs. A lot. It crashed on me many times while working on my projects. 
Later "versions" of "2.96" fixed this, but it was well after 3.0 was 
released that it finally seemed reasonably stable -- and at that point, 
I just wanted to use 3.0, so I did.
