Hi,

Thanks for the replies. It turns out that it was an IRQ conflict with an old 
sound card.

Despite checking the BIOS and running the 3c509 setup utility on 
http://www.scyld.com/diag, the 2.4 kernel still picked a card on IRQ 5 and 10.

It works fine now that the sound card is removed, but I'm still confused as to 
why this worked in 2.2.18 but not 2.4.19, seems like a regression to me...

Thanks again,

Cheers,
~Al
