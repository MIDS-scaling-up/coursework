First, 1,000 people will have seen the piece of spam that could've been avoided.  But the other 99,000 will never see that spam.  Evenly distributed, it means that an average user will only see 1% of spam.  That's not realistic, because not everyone will get the same spam, but the basic threshold can be adjusted.  At the very least, 30 people need to "vote" on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision.  Since there's no "no" vote mechanism (except revocation--and that's after the fact), only a "yes" vote mechanism exists and so if you received 30 "yes" votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample.

The system could pretend to have never seen the piece of mail until after it determined that it was probably spam.  So instead of a rating going up incrementally, it would take a big leap at the beginning (from undefined to a relatively high number) and then go from there.  So after the first group of people (our samplers, we'll say) have seen the spam, no one else would ever see it.

As far as unsubscribing, I'm always leery of clicking on the link (and don't do so unless I specifically remember signing up for something), but the sample population will decide for themselves whether they feel that it's spam.

So ultimately, I guess I'm saying that the most effective route would be to use a constantly changing sample pool and just accept that there is some fraction of users that will have to see the spam.  In a system that depends on people deciding whether or not something is spam, is there any other way?

Because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree. A
simplistic view would be that 999 subscribers received a piece of spam
that could have otherwise been avoided. But the reality is likely that
many, many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you
factor in report times.

Wrong. razor-check will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches
something already in the database. If you have the system pretend to have
never seen a piece of mail, how do you propose people use the system for
filtering?

No, it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion
than the 1000 people who have submitted it as spam. Rather the 1000 people
who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is
something that would have to be determined in the context of the
individual message.

You always have that ability.

It's my opinion that it's not my job to unsubscribe to any list that I
haven't subscribed to, nor is it necessarily in my best interest given
that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the
unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid
address.

See above.
