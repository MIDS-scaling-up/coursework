The current version of the Limbo beta is 7.3.93 (yeah, they should
have renamed it, but they didn't). It's in the same
redhat/linux/beta/limbo directory on the ftp servers. Just check the
redhat-release package to find out which version is on the server. 
Looking at ftp.redhat.com, the current one is redhat-release-7.3.93-2.

If you're using GNOME2 from the beta, I'd upgrade as there were some
important bugfixes since the first beta. The only thing to watch out
for is that Limbo2 switched gcc to 3.2, which is once again
incompatible with the previous gcc (v3.1 shipped in Limbo1).
