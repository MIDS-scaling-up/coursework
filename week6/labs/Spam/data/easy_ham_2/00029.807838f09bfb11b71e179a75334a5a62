You could pay a visit to your local cat sanctuary|cats home|shelter|pound and see if they have a beastie which matches your search terms (healthy + looks like Persian + good with kids); they won't charge you $ARM+LEG (probably they'll just ask for a donation) and I doubt your daughter will mind much where the cat came from.  The cat certainly won't mind, if he/she is well cared for afterwards!

Do take the cat to a vet for a checkup and make sure it gets the proper shots, etc.  Might be a good idea to have the "snip" done too while you're there. (the cat, not you!!)  Most sanctuaries will make sure these jobs are already done but you should make sure.

A word of warning, some cats in sanctuaries will have been mistreated in past lives and might not be good with kids, or could be quite nervous.  Bring your daughter to see the cat you've chosen to see how they react to one another.
