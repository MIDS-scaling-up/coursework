I just heard from Kevin Patrick Scannell, author of the Irish-language
ispell dictionary ("ispell-gaeilge") discussed a month or two ago.
He's revised it, and moreover has added a version for the much-better
aspell package ("aspell-gaeilge").  The latter is particularly good news
for users of OpenOffice.org.

Details for us anglophones:  http://borel.slu.edu/ispell/index-en.html
And in Irish:  http://borel.slu.edu/ispell/
