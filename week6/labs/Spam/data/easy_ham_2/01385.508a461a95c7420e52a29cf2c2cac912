Hi,

when testing spamassassin, i found a little problem but
I don't know if it's spamassassin or my pop3-server
that caused it.

Pop3-servers seem to expect a blank line before "From "-lines
to seperate mails in a mailbox-file.
Spamassassin does not add such a blank line before
mails delivered directly to mailbox.
Result is that the pop3-server (tested with qpopper4 and
cucipop) delivers some mails glued together.

I think the solution is to write a blank line to the mailbox
befor spamassassin adds the filtered mail.

Please tell me if you're not the right man for this,
 if i'm totally wrong or if you're sure, the pop3-server
 shouldn't insist on a blank line before "From "-lines.

Thank you.

PS: Mailserver ist postfix-1.1.11

Regards,
