andre seems to have a peculiar way of interacting with people on 
linux-kernel. martin otoh gets on fine with people, but doesnt /seem/ 
to have his head fully around the ide code yet¹.

however, how do you add features? eg tagged commands, udma100, 133, 
etc.. serial ATA, new chipsets. plus the IDE code might be fine, but 
lots of drives and chips have bugs, which need working around.

all that said, Linus says he does his development on an IDE machine
and hasnt had any problems.

1. judging from comments on l-k.
