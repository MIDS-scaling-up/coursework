This isn't a MIME message that it is breaking down though.  The
message as sent to me is just a regular one part, non-MIME message.
The contents of the message among other things is a forwarded message
(inline not as an attachment) that happens to have MIME parts.

I see 1-4 documented in the manpage.  2 looked like a good candidate
but the manpage states that only 1, 3, and 4 are on by default.  No
mention of method 5 though that I can see.

Actually I am using 2.14.

I have to run off to a meeting but I'll send you a copy of the logs
and the message that triggered as SPAM when I get back.  I'll also
revoke it along with the other 3 similar messages and the Security
Advisory that were wrongly called SPAM this morning.

Thanks.
