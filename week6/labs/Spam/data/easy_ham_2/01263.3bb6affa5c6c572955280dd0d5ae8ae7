Quite honestly, I thought that the last occurrence was the one that
counted. I'm almost sure I've already done something like :
%configure --bindir=%{_sbindir}
or even
%configure --sysconfdir=%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}

Are you sure that it was the first for you? Maybe you're forgetting to also
override it in %makeinstall like follows :
%makeinstall bindir=%{buildroot}%{_sbindir}
or even
%makeinstall sysconfdir=%{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/%{name}

Is that it?
