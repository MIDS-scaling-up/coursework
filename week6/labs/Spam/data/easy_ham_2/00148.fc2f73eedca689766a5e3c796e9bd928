ipfw was written specifically for FreeBSD under a bsd license by Luigi
Rizzo, who's one of the FreeBSD whizzes.  All three of the BSD's
packaged IPFilter, which has been around for donkeys years and which has
a slightly different feature set to ipfw.

However, last year the author of IPFilter (Darren Reed) changed the
license on development branches of ipfilter to prohibit redistribution,
although official releases would still be kept under the old license. 
This policy got up the nose of Theo de Raadt (lots of things do, which
is why OpenBSD exists in the first place), so OpenBSD re-invented the
wheel and called their firewall "pf", under a full-time BSD license.   

The standard release versions of ipfilter are unencumbered, as always.

I'm not so sure that ipfw2 is really ready for production yet, having
only been mfc'd last wednesday.  It certainly adds some nice syntactic
sugar, and is apparently much faster for certain types of complex
rulesets.  It will be good once it's had some time to settle down a
little.

ipfilter is quite nice, and is my current o/s firewall of choice.  It
has some nice features like the ability to save and restore state so
that connections are persistent across reboots, and its logging is
marginally better organised than ipfw's.  It's also very mature code,
which appeals to the rather conservative tastes of my old age.
