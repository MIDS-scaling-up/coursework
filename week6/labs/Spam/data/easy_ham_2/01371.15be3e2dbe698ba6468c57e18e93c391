Foundation newsletters, and [1]the July newsletter went out on Thursday.
If you donated to YAS and The Perl Foundation, you are already subscribed
at the email address you provided when you donated. If you haven't
donated and want to subscribe, send an empty email message to
foundation-newsletter-subscribe@perl.org (and also consider [2]donating
:-).

In other newsletter news, we have a [3]French translation of the July
newsletter on the web site. Thanks to mirod (Michel Rodriguez) for making
that happen. Translations into other languages are welcome--please
contact Kevin Meltzer (kevinm AT yetanother.org)."

I *heart* your translations!

recieved several feedback messages. Some have suggested changes, which we
appriciate and most will be implemented. But many of the messages were
just requesting it to become [2]search.cpan.org. So by popular demand the
switch will happen this weekend." Sweet!
