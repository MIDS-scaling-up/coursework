Oops, I tend to feel like that most times! I tend to feel that if we
have extremely good compilation tools, then those tools should be able
to do the inlining and optimisation far better than I could. That's the
theory anyway :) And there's always a tradeoff with inlining between
speed and memory bloat (which may sometimes be no tradeoff if swap
starts getting involved...)
