;-) Yep I know, but wee Daisy really loves Pokemon but she loves "persians"
equally, actually any cat really, its really me that wants the pokemon style
cat ;)

Yep 450 yoyo's for a wee one, thats a lot of fish food. And I might not even
get one in the Republic. An Abssynian you say looks like the pokemon
Persian? That would qualify nicely.

Thanks for the advice ladies, I now have TWO options. At least I still have
till Haloween before Daisy turns 5. D-Day.

CW
