D'oh. I ment to say that I cant use a laptop, as I have a pci wireless
card and the cable for it (about 180 dollars). So it has to be a pc, with
a pci 2.2 connector (ie some pentiums, and anything above)

I'd do that with my 166, but the psu has a fan. And a 486 wont support my
wireless card :( I know. I'm awkward,
