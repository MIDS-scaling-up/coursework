Dunno.. Some of the new Sonys (I'm hunting again for a lappy, as the
Toshiba I have is a large piece of cow manure)  which promise a 4 hour
battery life off of ONE battery are pretty damn impressive.  As far as
the keyboard issue, the Toshiba actually came out with a good
keyboard, nearly equivalent to most standard keyboards (Not ergonomic,
alas, but I have a USB happy ergo keyboard I can always plug in if I
get restless).   I can't imagine surviving at Law school without a
lappy, but thats just me.

then again, I don't know what you do with your laptops, Gene :)
