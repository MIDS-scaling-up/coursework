audience with video recorders. That's fine with me, but now I want to see
the recordings! I saw at least two people recording 'Mailing List Judo'
and 'Conference Presentation Judo.' If you do have a video, please drop
me a note. Thanks." I wouldn't mind an audio or video recording of my
YAPC talk either, if someone had such a beast.
