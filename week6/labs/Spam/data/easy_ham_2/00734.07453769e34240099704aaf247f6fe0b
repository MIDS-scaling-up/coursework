This topic comes up every so often on this list.  The short answer is 
no, there really isn't an IMAP server which knows how to do this.

The longer answer is, UW-IMAP claims it does, but doesn't do a good 
job, and doesn't update scan caches, unseen, etc.

You may have better luck while on the road using raw mh commands to 
read you e-mail if you have ssh access to your internal environment.
I've been doing this for quite a long time, and, after the learning 
curve of the mh command set (which I still don't know completely),
I'm quite able to access my e-mail and respond to those e-mails which 
require a response.

Another option is using mutt as your mail client when you're remotely 
accessing e-mail.  Mutt does a decent job of dealing with mh folders, 
though it doesn't update scan caches or unseen files either.  But it 
is a decent interface alternative to raw mh, and it's quite 
customizable.

The real answer to your question is that we need not an IMAP server 
that understands mh folders, but an mh server to which a local client 
could connect to.  In theory, it shouldn't be too hard (technically) 
to cobble this together with ssh.  Replace all of exmh's calls to mh 
commands with a wrapper which uses ssh to lob these commands over to 
a remote system, and dump the output back into the local exmh client.
