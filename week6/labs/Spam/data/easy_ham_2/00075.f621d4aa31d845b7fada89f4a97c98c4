Now here is a thought: a Unix version of the "Deleted Items" folder.

In the root of a hard drive, create a directory ".unwanted". Then
periodically create hard links to every file on the hard drive that does not
have hard links.

That way, when someone accidentally does "rm *" or whatever, you still have
a link under ".unwanted"

Another script can then periodically clear out enough old files to ensure
that there is usually enough disk space.

Although this sounds like a horrible hack. It would no doubt be much better
to have a transaction oriented file system with a rollback facility.  :)
