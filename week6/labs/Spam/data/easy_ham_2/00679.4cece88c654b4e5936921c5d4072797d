[0]Richard Foley writes "Share your 'pe[a]rls of wisdom' with the Perl
community: attendees from all around the world, gurus and geeks alike,
will converge on Munich for [0]YAPC::Europe Sept. 18-20 to listen to the
talks and tutorials presented at this gathering of minds. This year's
theme is 'The Science of Perl', which means that we would really like to
hear about suggestions for talks, projects, experiences which involve
both perl and science. This should not be regarded as a restriction, more
as a 'nice to have' :-) Proposals may be submitted between January 1st
2002 and July 30th 2002."

[0]jhi writes "After more than two long years of hard work, the
perl5-porters is proud to announce Perl 5.8.0. The most important new
features are enhanced Unicode and threads support, and the new I/O
subsystem called PerlIO, but there are lots of new goodies, not to
mention bazillion bug fixes.

The full [1]announcement is available, and you can read [2]what is new in
5.8.0, and if you like what you see, start [3]installing.

Since this release has extensive support for non-Latin scripts, we also
translated the announcement to [4]Traditional Chinese (Big5-ETEN),
[5]Simplified Chinese (EUC-CN or GB2312), [6]Japanese (EUC-JP), and
[7]Korean (EUC-KR) (by Autrijus Tang, Dan Kogai, and Jungshik Shin).

[8]ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/src/perl-5.8.0.tar.gz is the main URL to
use, but of course any CPAN mirror will do once they catch up.

Share and Enjoy!

-- Jarkko Hietaniemi, on behalf of the Perl5 Porters"
