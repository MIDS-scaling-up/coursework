"SpamAssassin Killed My Independence Day Party"

With all the spam that gets through, I had no idea
a filter was in effect at the FoRK listserv. 

Turn it off! It not only risks silent false 
positives, but suffers them in such a way that 
individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. 

Also, anti-spam startups need end-users. 
Centralized spam fighting takes food out
of those coders' mouths!

I still think self-add whitelists are underrated. 
A FoRK whitelist would presumably start with
all subscribers, and grow from there. Bouncing
problem mail, in a way that humans can understand
how to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids 
the problem of silent failures without opening the 
door to lazy, forged-"from" spammers.
