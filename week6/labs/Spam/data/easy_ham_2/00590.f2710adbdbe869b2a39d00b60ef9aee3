Wow. I think a majority of the anti-spam community out there would disagree
with you. It makes no difference what the list is, whether it's run by ZDNet
or Empire Towers, whether it uses open proxies and relays or a MLM like
mailman or Lyris. In either case I was added to a list against my will to 
receive unsolicited bulk email. I shouldn't have to 'just unsubscribe from
the list' any more than I should have to send email with the subject REMOVE
to removemeblahblah1234@yahoo.com or go to http://www.centralremovelist.com/
to 'unsubscribe' from some viagra spam. Or are you advocating that as well?

That's fine. But my point is that neither person in my example was
committing an inherently untrustworthy act. Yet someone's TES would likely
fall because of it.

Hmm. Good point about razor-whitelist. I'd forgotten about that.
