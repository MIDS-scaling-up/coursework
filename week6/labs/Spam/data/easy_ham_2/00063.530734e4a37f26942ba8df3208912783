>>From the website:
"Spackle is designed to be a flexible client/server architecture for the 
gathering and displaying of statistics, primarily suited to monitoring 
servers. It's written in PHP and bash shell script, uses RRDtool  for stats 
logging, and PostgreSQL for the server-side database. (soon to support MySQL 
as well)"

I had this up and running within a few hours. The hardest bit was getting 
PostgreSQL running as it's been a few years since I used it. I had a bit of a 
problem getting it to work on rh6.2 boxes but I documented the changes here: 
http://xeer.blogspot.com/?/2002_07_01_xeer_archive.html#79148596

Web interface is simple, but functional. It has a simple way of distributing 
the monitoring scripts (which could be compromised but I digress), and the 
resulting graphs are pretty!

Donncha.
