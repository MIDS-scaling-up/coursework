How about xcin?
http://xcin.linux.org.tw/

This is an example of an XIM approach that Brian mentioned. hint shift-space 
get you back to typing in english.

The speed you can type at will be very dependent on how well you know the 
input method and in some cases how well you know how to construct chinese 
characters.

I have seen people using electronic pen and tablet devices to just write the 
characters in, though that was windows.
