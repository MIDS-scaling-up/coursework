Very nice. Not sure it's worthwhile to pay for that when I'm already
paying for cable modem at home, but... still nice to know I have the
option.

FWIW, slummerville actually has the internet- not just broadband, but
actual broadband competition, which I gather is rare. I had ADSL and two
cable options when I moved in.
