<a name="When:1:56:53PM">Well, yesterday I went for my 30-day post op review (it was actually 38 days after I was discharged) and there was good news and bad news. The good news is that I'm healing quickly. My body is very strong and doing really well. My blood pressure is great. Heart rate is great. Cholesterol needs work and I have to lose a bunch of weight, and of course I can't smoke. Now the bad news. I have to be a saint for the rest of my life. I knew this day was coming. As I start to feel better, I want to relax. That ain't going to happen. Oy. Here's my <a href="http://www.ciudadfutura.com/poprock/allmwast.html">old theme song</a>.

As a Mets <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/1995/04/24/thebaseballgod">fan</a> since 1962, I think it's great that sites like this exist and are flourishing. Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go <a href="http://www.metsonline.net/metsonline-ceaseandde
 sist.html">deeper</a> you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind. But to the owners of the Mets, please remember, it's the fans that make it work, and it's pretty clear that this website is from the fans, for the fans and the team, and that's a good thing.&nbsp;<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/07/30#When:7:11:28AM" title="Permanent link to this item in archive."><img src="http://www.scripting.com/images/2001/09/20/sharpPermaLink3.gif" height="9" width="6" border="0"></a><br><br>
