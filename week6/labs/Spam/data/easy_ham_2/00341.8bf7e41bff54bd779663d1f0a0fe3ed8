I apologise for wasting your time.

I follow this list from home, and thus use
a yahoo account. I haven't been able to find
a threading mechanism for this, plus the
fact that the list can start to fill up
my inbox after about a week of no pruning.

This is the reason for my initial grumbling. I 
would like to be able to follow what's going
on without clogging up my yahoo account.


Anyway, I should have initiated a new thread for my
different request about S.u.S.E. CDs. I won't repeat
my error!


Again, my humble apologies.



Paul...
