A pastor walked into a neighborhood pub.  The place was hopping
with music and dancing but every once in a while the lights would
turn off.  Each time after the lights would go out the place would
erupt into cheers.

However, when the revelers saw the town pastor, the room went dead
silent.  He walked up to the bartender and asked, "May I please
use the restroom?"

The bartender replied, "I really don't think you should."

"Why not?" the pastor asked.

"Well, there is a statue of a naked woman in there, and her most
private part is covered only by a fig leaf."

"Nonsense," said the pastor, "I'll just look the other way."

So the bartender showed the clergyman the door at the top of the
stairs, and he proceeded to the restroom.  After a few minutes, he
came back out, and the whole place was hopping with music and
dancing again.  However, they did stop just long enough to give
the pastor a loud round of applause.  He went to the bartender and
said, "Sir, I don't understand.  Why did they applaud for me just
because I went to the restroom?"

"Well, now they know you're one of us," said the bartender.  "Would
you like a drink?"

"But, I still don't understand," said the puzzled pastor.

"You see," laughed the bartender, "every time the fig leaf is lifted
on the statue, the lights go out in the whole place.  Now, how
about that drink?"
