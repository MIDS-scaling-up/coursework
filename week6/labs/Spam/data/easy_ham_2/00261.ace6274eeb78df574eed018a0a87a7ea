Hello all,
I'm trying to get wins name resolution across subnets working and reckon the
first step is to be 
able to do a nmblookup without using the -B (broadcast address flag). Does
anyone know how 
samba can be configured to do broadcasts to subnets other than just the
local subnet. 
I don't think this has anything to do with the remote announce parameter.

Thanks
Bryan
