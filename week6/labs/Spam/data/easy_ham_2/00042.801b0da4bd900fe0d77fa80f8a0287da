yep, that's what i learned as it seemed more useful then the other
choice: french.  and that's what seems to count as "internationalisation":
support of spanish.

if i go to a class, i'm there to learn.  if they throw in anthems or
politics, i'll take what i can learn from that and i'll take in a new
perspective, but i'll only do that with my critical thinking cap on.
just like i do when i watch mass media.  and yes, from the one irish
course i took in dublin, they do the national anthem.  which is fine
really - i started off each day in school in america with the pledge of
allegience (with the under god bit in it which annoyed my dad to no end).
if that sort of thing didn't stick at the age of five, i severely doubt
it will stick now.

and see, that would be my retort to any overly zealous irish speaker.
there's a huge opportunity for a fully irish computing environment in
free software.  and yet i don't see much action from official irish
organisations.  the reason mandrake and some others have the irish
support they have is because of individuals like donnacha.
