Security Advisory - RHSA-2002:158-09
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
New kernel update available, fixes i810 video oops, several security issues

Updated kernel packages are now available which fix an oops in the i810 3D
kernel code. This kernel update also fixes a difficult to trigger race in
the dcache (filesystem cache) code, as well as some potential security
holes, although we are not currently aware of any exploits.

Description:
The 2.4.18-5 kernel introduced some safety checks in the VM subsystem that
were triggered when exiting an X session while using 3D acceleration with
the Intel i810/i815 chipset. Additionally, there was a difficult to trigger
race in the dcache of the file system subsystem.

This kernel update addresses both of these issues.

In addition, there are fixes for potential security holes in the following
drivers:

stradis
rio500
se401
usbvideo
apm

Finally, this kernel fixes a few files in the /proc file system which had
the capability to expose kernel memory when abused.

All of the security issues found during an audit and none of them,  at the
time of this writing, have any known exploits.

We would like to thank Silvio Cesare, Stas Sergeev, Andi Kleen, Solar
Designer, and others for their auditing work.
