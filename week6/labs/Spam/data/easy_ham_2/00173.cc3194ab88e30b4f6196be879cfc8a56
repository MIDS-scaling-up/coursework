Going rapidly OT here, but I find it shocking that anybody could be
proud of not knowing something. It's like the tourist on holidays using
that speak-loudly-enough-and-they-will-understand technique or (slightly
less off-topic) the friend or relative who says "I know nothing
about computers!" and clearly doesn't intend to learn, and is happy
to let you clean up after them.

I certainly agree that Irish is not taught all that well (or wasn't
when I was in school) but I'd like to be able to relearn it and to
count it as one of my skills.

David
