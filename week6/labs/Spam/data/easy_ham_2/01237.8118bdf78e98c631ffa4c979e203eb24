Well, thanks everyone for the explanations. I still disagree with the 
reasoning, but it seems this is one of those philosophical questions 
that I'm on the losing end of :)

The checkinstall utility that someone mentioned seems useful, but I 
don't really have the time to figure it out right now. After searching 
the web some more, I found out that Mandrake's version of rpm is 
patched to support what I wanted. So I guess I'll look into that when 
I get a chance.

As far as I can tell, this could be useful for my situation too. It's 
not a complete solution since I can't really distribute the SRPMS with 
full certainty that they work, but at least I can make RPMS for local 
use by tarring up the buildroot directory and then using the above 
technique. All I really want is to get dependency tracking for 
everything installed on my system (including software from cvs). This 
just makes it a little bit faster.
