There's been some discussion just now on the ILUG IRC channel about OSI and
protocol layers. This reminded me of a poster produced by Wandel &
Goltermann (manufactureres of fine protocol decoders and testers) which
illustrates this admirably. The poster is in the form of a PDF file and to
be honest, is best appreciated if you have access to a HP DesignJet or
somesuch device. Wandel & Goltermann has now become/been taken over by
acterna and I couldn't find the poster there. However, it's available at
http://www.pb.bib.de/~dozloh/fachinfo/sdn_16/decodes.pdf and some of you ma
find it interesting.

The top of the poster refers you to www.decodes.com for a more up to date
online copy of the poster. However, www.decodes.com now is redirected to the
aforementioned acterna and . . . .
