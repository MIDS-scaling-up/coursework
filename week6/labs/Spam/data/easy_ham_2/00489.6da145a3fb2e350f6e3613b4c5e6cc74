Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. 

I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)
