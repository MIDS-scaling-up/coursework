It's quite a bit more than natural selection; the times had a
fascinating article a few months back (possibly posted as bits here)
that note that one Holstein bull who died in the 70s is paternally
related to something like 40% of the world's cattle. That's way, way
more than natural selection, and (given the difficulty and expense of
isolating specific genes for size, industrial-living-ness, etc.) more
expansive than raw gene manipulation will be for some time.
