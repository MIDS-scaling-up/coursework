well, it changes the time then, and then leaves it alone.

However, Windows expects the time in the RTC to be local time. Linux
can be configured to do either this, or to have the RTC at UTC,
and then use /etc/localtime to figure out the right timezone.

Depending on how you've set it up, this may be a problem (with one
or other of the OS's one hour out). OS-X also does this silliness :(

(RTC should always have UTC, that way different people can set their
own timezone on the machine... though I suppose that only applies
to multi-user machines).
