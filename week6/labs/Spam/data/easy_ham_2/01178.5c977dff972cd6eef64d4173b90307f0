Well, you can simply use an rpm tarball (or extract one from a source rpm
on a machine that has rpm scripts install "rpm2cpio <file.src.rpm> | cpio
-dimv" and "./configure && make && make install" as usual. You need db3 or
db4 development files at least, and once everything installed you'll need
to initialize your rpm database.

If you need more help, I suggest you join the rpm-list@redhat.com by
