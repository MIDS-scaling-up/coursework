The goverment mindset is now, If you know a vulnerability and let it on to
anyone BUT the manufacturer you are a criminal...end of story, go directly
to jail do not collect 200$ and tip a hat to the citizen infromants who
helped get you there.

So this leaves lucrative contracts for those who find and then NDA the
find with the manufacturer with, if the finder is smart, an imunity from
any prosecution in the future so long as the NDA is kept.


Oh my droogie, those who are in the shirt hairs hanging of the new age
employemnt market, this could be your golden molden moment to strike the
new gold mine...and perhaps coopt it fromthe start.....

There are two ways to fight the powers that be, from with out and from
with in...lets not turn a blind eye towards one becuase someone, yes
someone, will do the deed and if that someone does not have the "make em
weak for the revultion to come" mindset then we are all and truly doomed.

Fight without
Fight within
