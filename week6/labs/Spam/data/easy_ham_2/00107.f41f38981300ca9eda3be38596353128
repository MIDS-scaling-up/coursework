Hi Kevin,

In the past when administering large domains, I've used the DNSTool -
http://www.gormand.com.au/tools/dnstool/guide.html

One custom change I made to this tool was to modify it so that it used a
combination of OpenSSH and sudo for remote commands, file transfers, etc.

This may, or may not be what you're after - I'm presuming that you're
considering writing a tool to do the maintenance of the domains?

Regards,
  Andrew

i recently received this email from a friend of mine in the states:

    i'm trying to figure out how to maintain about 200 domains, with a
    hundred or so computers per domain.  some internal, some external.
    i recently learned lex and yacc and i'm thinking that's the way to go.
    i don't really know perl and i know it's useful but i think i can
    write c faster then perl.

    is this a good idea?

    ps  we're really busy.

obviously as a stupid developer with no real admin experience to speak
of, i'm not qualified to answer this question.  does anyone with real
admin experience have any suggestions here?  the problem sounds really
hard, and i doubt anyone has had to deal with this level of complexity
so there probably aren't any existing tools written.

anyone else have any opinions or experience i could pass on?

kevin
