hmm. there are versions of OpenBSD that run from a 32M compact flash IIRC.

and antefacto's software ran in 64M.

there are CF->IDE adapters anyway, so get a 256M CF (100¤+), mount it RO,
and use that?

/me is also in the market for one of the 60W fanless PSU's that antefacto had,
if someone wants to get a few of them.
