Drains what? My wallet you mean? America _is_ greed, that's who and what we
are.

Those old white dudes could never see a world that wasnt ALL deeply
religeous (science wasnt up to speed yet). How could you not hold these
principles as just how you should act? They got that religeon and government
should not be the same thing, they didnt get that when society doesnt have
any beliefs are all (capitalism is more atheist then communism ever was) it
quickly goes to hell as some people have 100 billion and all the rest have
too dolla a day.

Having been raised in a generally ethical way, it was a big jump to learn to
run a business. Lots of lessions in being ruthless, and a few about being
sure to hire large Italians to do debt collection (it works!).

No shit, really? Seriously, if you're not all about screwing over the
customer, there is no place for you in the ruling class, and you certainly
cant play the American game.

That's living, here we only work, buy, and work more to buy more, like rats
on a wheel. I can't wait to be rich enough to move somewhere nice, if they
will let me get out alive that is.
