	It's still quite easy to find out, pre-purchase, what components if
any are going to give you problems with a specific distribution/version.
With Dell just check the support.dell.com site, match the system, look for
downloadable drivers. From these if there aren't any linux drivers you can
usually find out the chipset of each device. Plug them into google with
"linux" and see what people have to say about them. Generally speaking when
you buy the system you'll be told the make/model of each device rather than
the chipset, so further investigation is necessary.

	The cavaet, of course, is always to know exactly what you're buying.
In most people's cases unfortunately it's not the person who bought the
systems that will be configuring them.
