I honestly don't know.  I made that list a long time ago, and certainly
didn't re-research it before posting it today.  So, I offer three
candidate explanations:

1.  I muffed that part, the first time, and was talking through my hat.
2.  SAP had a proprietary version licensed to SuSE at the time.
3.  SAP still have one licensed to SuSE today.

I'm not sure which applies.  #1 is certainly a good possibility.
