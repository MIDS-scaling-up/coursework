Strange.

I had the double IRQ problem with the 3c509 combo, 
and turning pnp off in the card's firware fixed it.

As far as I remember the problem I was having was 
that the driver was assigning an IRQ to the card's
 RJ45 port and then another IRQ to it's BNC port,
 and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq,
 and turning off PnP in the card's firmware fixed that.

You must be having a different error
Else
PnP is still turned on.
<<Obvious suggestion entails>>
Making sure the IRQ and io space you assign
the card in it's firmware is not in use by
any other ISA devices.
