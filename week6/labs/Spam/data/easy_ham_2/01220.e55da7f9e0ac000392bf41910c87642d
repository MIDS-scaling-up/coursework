Hi,

	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just 
fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
anymore. 
The output is :

input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status
           of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
           Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.

I'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of 
rolling back updates ?

Nick Verhaegen
