Some of the reasons they don't own it is because it is government land
that you can't convert without an army of lawyers.

In other cases, you originally had owners who didn't have the 'right' to
subdivide, but they subdivide anyway.

It is interesting to note that for several centuries in Japan it was a
death sentence to sell land.  They sold it anyway, and kept records.

In the US, we eventually got quite friendly with squatters and adverse
possession, and integrated out extra-legal arrangements and 'spontaneous
social contracts' into the official law.

Mr. Long, I think you'd particularly enjoy the De Soto work.
