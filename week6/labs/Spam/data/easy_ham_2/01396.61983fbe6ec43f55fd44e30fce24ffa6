A bizarre collection of stuffed animals could fetch up to £2m when it is
sold by a Cornwall museum.
The Museum of Curiosities is home to a menagerie of 10,000 Victorian stuffed
animals.
The museum, next to the Jamaica Inn on Bodmin Moor, gets about 30,000
visitors a year.
But now the inn's owner Kevin Moore has decided to sell.

Stuffed frogs are for sale

Mr Moore said: "It was very fashionable to have taxidermy on your
mantlepiece in Victorian times, but it is not really in favour now."
Nevertheless, figures of up to £2m for the collection have been discussed.
The museum was opened in 1861 by taxidermist Walter Potter.
Tableaux include a kittens tea party, cricket-playing guinea pigs and
swinging frogs.
