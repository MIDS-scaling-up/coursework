Ahhh ... this is funny. Last night I upgraded to Limbo II (.93).

Installed Limbo II kernel, Installed libstdc++ from rawhide (rpm -ivh) so the
newer apt would work, told apt it is OK to have multiple of libstdc++, copied
the actual rawhide "libstdc++.so.5.0.0" file to another directory, removed that
rawhide libstdc++ package, installed (rpm -ivh ) the Limbo II libstdc++ package
(new apt does not like it), make that symlink "libstdc++.so.5" point to that
rawhide file I moved earlier.

Apt works again, dump the Limbo II rpms into a dir, run the "genaptrep.sh rh73",
but "topdir" arg had changed, edit script, rerun, makes apt repository for Limbo
II. Do "apt-get --ignore missing -f dist-upgrade". Apt wants to uninstall itself
because that rawhide libstdc++ package is not installed, but apt works for the
moment because of that symlink I made.

Apt stays installed just long enough to issue the necessary "dist-upgrade"
commands, several hours later, I have Limbo II, shiny and new. The install even
made that symlink point back to the correct libstdc++ file.

Several hours after that, I read my mail and realize that "null" directory I kept
seeing while downloading Limbo II was not a fluke.

Ahh, the joy. Repeat the above ....

That's "angle" as in geometry.
