Irish is taught badly in schools. But then again so is French. I did 3 years
of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. 

The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...

I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
"forced" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).

Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)

Nick
