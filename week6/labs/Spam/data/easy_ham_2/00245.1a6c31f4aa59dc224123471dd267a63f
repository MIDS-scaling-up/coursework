  |  There is no canonical test, and the information is not necessarily
  |  available.  [ ... ]  This information is also shown by ls -lc, but
  |  parsing ls' output requires a bit of effort. I'd rather recommend
  |  [ writing ] a short C program to access the file status directly,
  |  and output the ctime directly (seconds since the epoch, i.e. perfect
  |  |  for numerical comparison).

 some systems have a stat(1) tool --- don't think it's GNU --
 which, when given the `-t' option, does exactly what Lars is
 suggesting:

   $ stat -t /etc/motd
   /etc/motd 21 8 81a4 0 0 303 79 1 0 0 1028070983 830730492 1013296719

 minor problem is the `-t' format is not actually explained in
 the man page, but its fairly easy to work out (or you can just
 look at the source).  also, since the filename is printed as
 the first "field", bizarre filenames (e.g., ones which contain
 spaces or newlines) can confuse a simple script.

cheers!
