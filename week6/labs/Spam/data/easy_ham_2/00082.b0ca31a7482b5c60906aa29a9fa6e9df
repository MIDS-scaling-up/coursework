Howdy all, 

I have a friend with the problem outlined below, suggestions anyone?


"I have a dell inspirion 2650 laptop, with a P4 1.6GHz proc., an Nvidia Geforce II graphics card (8Mb) and am trying  to 
install redhat 7.3 .
The installation goes nicely until the Xwindows setup. My graphics card IS detected but not the monitor. I have  
randomly chosen various LCD laptop display monitors but none seem to work, problem is that when i test a  particular 
monitor the screen doesn't default back to the nice clear picture  i have become acustomed to but  remains fuzzy and 
flashy so it is impossible to test another monitor type. rebooting allows me to run in text mode  where i try to configure X 
again with Xconfigurator but i run into the same problem again.

Very annoying..."

Ta very, 

R
