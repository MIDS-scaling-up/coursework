Try the following newsgroups - 
Beginners:
news:comp.lang.learn.c-c++

More advanced: 
news:comp.lang.c
news:comp.lang.c++
news:comp.lang.c.moderated

Also, you should keep a bookmark pointing at the comp.lang.c FAQ at 
http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html

For tutorials, the guy who maintains the clc FAQ (Steve Summit)
has a tutorial - http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/top.html
Also you could have a look at the excercises he poses - all
linked from http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/cclass.html

For C++, I would guess that the comp.lang.c++ FAQ is a good place
to start - they're likely to have links to suggested reading
material.

If you're going to do any amount of C programming, you should
think about getting K&R2 (The C programming language, 2nd
edition, by Kernighan and Ritchie), for C++ the equivalent book
is Stroustrup. Although the C++ book is a lot bigger :)

Hope this helps,
Dave.
