duly noted

definately would make the extra effort to talk directly with these people
and mention to the IFC (local arts cinema) about a more approriate
showing.

Would enough people in ILUG be interested to cover the possible costs
of a showing some Saturday afternoon/morning.

Anyway this is distant future anyway i have too much on my plate already.

I hope the DVD they produce wont be region coded, damned anti-consumer
cartels and monoplistic tendencies of coporate greed.

Is this the same film the 2600 people are always going on about or is that
something else?

Later
Alan
