If we're willing to count artificial
selection as genetic engineering, it
has been happening since pre-literate
times, and is called "domestication".

I can see the value to a system which
guaranteed that the truck would show
up with all items as ordered -- but if
there's going to be spoilage anyway, I
don't see how much value that "clean"
invoice provides -- just think about
the costs of reliable networks versus
reliable protocols on unreliable ones.

If the trucks are unreliable, then the
sticky pads seem like the clear winner
for return on IT capital investment.
