I develop software and my pricing is that I charge the first set of
customers that drive the features included quite a bit, then charge the
majority of the customers a small fee, and when I've earned back what I
invested (including my hourly wage) then I release that software for free
and either start working on a newer version (again back to the adding
features step) or on a new product. If you can't find someone willing to
pay your costs of development then most likely there really isn't a need
for the product you're trying to sell and you shouldn't develop it. If you
have to resort to free versions with lame ass ads and stuff then that is a
strong indication to get a new project IMO.  :)
