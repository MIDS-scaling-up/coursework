Hi guys,
   slightly OT. This comes from The Register from last

http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26207.html

   Some/all of you may know that the government in
Peru were going to instruct state bodies to look at
using open source software in an attempt to save money
over M$ licences. Well, read the above article.
