And yet, in my experience, it still happens, but always "unofficially"
and "off the record".  It's as if we believe that "the gods" will
punish us if we are seen to have behaved in a human fashion while on
company time, either by being caught red-handed, or having the
paper-trail finger us later.  Yet even CEOs will "pull strings" to
make things happen, and, also in my experience, those are the moments
when things actually do happen.
