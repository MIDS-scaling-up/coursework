why?

or more specifically, what do you mean?  on one hand you can optimise
how gcc is compiled.  all that will do is make it generate the exact
same code just a smidge faster.  and since gcc is such a memory pig,
you'd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep
gcc's heap out of swap.

on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect it's
code generation.  um, ok, but keep in mind that compiler errors suck.
i can't express that enough.  compilers should just work.  perfectly.
always.  doing anything that might affect that is, in my opinion, insane.
they're hard to trace and you'd better have a deep knowledge of what's
going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it
yourself.  plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes
to get large speed boosts on x86 chips.
