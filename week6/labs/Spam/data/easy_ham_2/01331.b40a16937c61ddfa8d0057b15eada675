easy walking tour around the city of Munich, for all those long-suffering
partners coming to YAPC::Europe, as a sort of treat for putting up with
the other half going to this very interesting event. Just to be clear:
we're not after any conference participant/attendees on this, only those
who are waiting until all the perl talk has finished (perl-widows and the
like). We'd like to have an idea of numbers, please, ahead of time, so:
[1]RSVP. Thanks!"
