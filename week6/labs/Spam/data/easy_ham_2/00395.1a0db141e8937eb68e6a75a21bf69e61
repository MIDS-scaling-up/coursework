Have you tried gconf-editor? It's a GUI front-end to gconf
settings (and metacity has it's settings handled by gconf, like
all good gnome2 apps). It's true there's no designated metacity
configurator - but the whole point of metacity is to have
reasonable defaults, and thus get away from the need for settings
altogether, and have the window manager be not in the way (as so
many are).

As to the sawfish issue, no idea, sorry - are you sure that
gnome2's panel handles 1.4 applets at all?

Cheers,
Dave.
