No, the 7.3 dvdrtools works with DVD-R and DVD-RW, this package works
with DVD+R and DVD+RW. (Confused yet?) Unfortuantely these tools don't
have a gui frontend, but since the workhorse is a wrapper for mkisofs,
that shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows how to do those things.

Well that was an image I put together of just the first three disks of
the distro. Make it bootable too. Fun, but slower than a network
install.
