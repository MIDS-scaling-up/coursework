And Owen replied:

I don't work in this area, but I have a suspicion that many people
suspect projects for "knowledge management" and "knowledge sharing" as
attempts to eliminate their jobs, or at least their importance. If "the
organization" knows all the things I know, why does it need me?

This should actually be easy to test experimentally: compare the results
of having someone call up and say, "Can you show us how to do X for this
project we're working on?" with those of having someone summoned by a
knowledge management project to explain how to do X for the knowledge
archives.
