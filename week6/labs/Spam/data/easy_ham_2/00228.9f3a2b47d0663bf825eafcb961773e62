Where does cron log to? (check /etc/syslog.conf) 

Usually it's something like /var/log/cron.log or /var/log/cron 

Anyways have a look in the logs, make sure your backup ran (so long
as there weren't any errors).

Typically if there's any output from the commands you've run,
they're mailed to you.
