Spray a bit of wd40 around the screw, and leave for a few minutes

Try using a small crocodile-nosed pliers if you have enough space around
th head of the screw. If not, try a hacksaw blade on the shaft of the
screw under the board (taking care not to scratch the underside of the
board. after cutting the screw, that holder on the board support structure
cannot really be used again.

Another method is to get a small screwdriver that you can consider
disposable, and gently tap it into the head of the stripped screw, until
you either have a flat head screw, or you can get enough turning force
 on it.

Cathal.
