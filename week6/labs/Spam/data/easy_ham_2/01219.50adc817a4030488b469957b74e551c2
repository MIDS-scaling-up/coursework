Not really, it should have given more embarrassment to sloppy C++
programmers although they often were the ones bashing on gcc 2.96...

There are already patches for this, look at the Conectiva apt-list
archives, you should find them there. Also, apt 0.5 is being actively
developed and already contains enough fixes to be compiled on Limbo with
gcc 3.2.

You can still use an apt package compiled on Red Hat Linux 7.3 as long as
you install the "rpm404" package for compatibility. That's what I'm doing
currently on my home Rawhide system.
