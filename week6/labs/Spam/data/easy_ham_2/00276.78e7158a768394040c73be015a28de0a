Is this to mount an OS-X partition?
The following would be of interest in that case:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=101198676827824&w=2

summary is you should be able to mount FFS readonly,
and the config item probably UFS:

[padraig@pixelbeat ~]$ grep UFS /boot/config-2.4.18-3
CONFIG_UFS_FS=m
# CONFIG_UFS_FS_WRITE is not set

So `modprobe ufs` should work on a standard RH7.3 install?

Pádraig.
