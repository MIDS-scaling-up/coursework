/Enter the rant.

One thing that really bugs me is when people say things like.

"On the machies we have these days you don't have to worry about
 writing optimised code" or "don't worry about writing
 things inline, just use a function"

"Yeah and add a procedure prolog or eight", I always counter,
to be told
"On the machines we have these days....."

Boggle.
