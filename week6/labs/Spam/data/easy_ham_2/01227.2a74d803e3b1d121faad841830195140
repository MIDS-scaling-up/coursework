Nice! :-)
What about the "dvdrecord" package that's already included in 7.3? It
doesn't do what this one does? I'm asking this because I've got a friend
with an iMac running YellowDog Linux (basically Red Hat Linux for PPC), and
it's one of the newer versions with a DVD burner. I'd be very interested in
using his drive to burn DVDs full of 2-CDs movies or full of "files for
xmame" ;-)
Also, a bootable DVD of Red Hat Linux 7.3 would be great as I've still not
burned the CDs even once for myself since I always install through the
network (and haven't found an easy way of purchasing an english boxed set
here in Spain...).
