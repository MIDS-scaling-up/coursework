Well, I tried the Ximian GNOME 2.0 packages from
http://apt.sunnmore.net, and have to say, it was a let-down.  Ran
'apt-get update' , 'apt-get install gnome-session' then 'apt-get
upgrade' and Nautilus failed to execute, couldn't get any help docs to
come up, along with more problems.  So, with the luck of 'rpm -qa|grep
ximian' then removing by hand all ximian packages with 'rpm -e --nodeps'
and reinstalling everything GNOME and GNOME-related with apt, I got
trusty old Red Hat 7.3 GNOME back on the desktop, and the only trace of
Ximian is Evolution, again, thanks to apt from this site.

I really liked Ximian (back then, Helix ?) at first but, to me, Red
Hat's GNOME, released with 7.3 seems much more pretty and up-to-date. 
Could this be because of inclusion of gtk2 in RH 7.3?
