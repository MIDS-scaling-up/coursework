It would appear that Yahoo! has joined the ranks of western companies
dedicated to helping restrict the freedoms of people in other countries
for the sake of improving their profit margins. Yahoo! has signed the
"Public Pledge on Self-discipline for China Internet Industry" (more
here http://www.dfn.org/voices/china/selfdiscipline.htm ), essentially a
promise to help police Chinese internet users for the
State:

>>>From this article in The Nando Times:
http://www.nandotimes.com/technology/story/494845p-3946998c.html

The Chinese version of the popular Yahoo! Internet portal risks becoming
an online policeman for China's communist government if it keeps a promise
to voluntarily investigate potentially subversive content, a human rights
group has warned.

"If it implements the pledge, Yahoo! will become an agent of Chinese law
enforcement," Kenneth Roth, Human Rights Watch's executive director, said
Friday. "It will switch from being an information gateway to an
information gatekeeper."

More from Human Rights Watch.
