The problem is clearly because the info isn't syncing between the
servers.  If I run the check against honor which is where it was
reported then the check is positive.  If I run the check against apt or
fire, it's negative.

It's still doing it.  I reported a message as spam 10 minutes ago and
the check keeps coming back false.  What's funny is that message that
I'm testing with it the sample-spam.txt message from SpamAssassin and I
know it's been reported before.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.
