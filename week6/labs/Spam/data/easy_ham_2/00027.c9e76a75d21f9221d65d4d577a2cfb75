You're going to get Significant Frowns from your average cat breeder
if you say you want a cat who looks like a Pokémon.

Why is that Pokémon called "Persian", anyway - it looks nothing like a
Persian cat?  It does look like a Siamese or (more likely)
Abyssinian.  If you want one of these breeds, I hope you're prepared
to part with ¤BIGNUM; they're not cheap.

There aren't a lot of "quality" cat breeders in Ireland, and they tend
not to have many kittens for sale, so I don't know how feasible it is
to get a Siamese or Abyssinian in a hurry.  "Not very", is my best
guess.

Siamese *in general* aren't the friendliest of cats; they tend to be
slightly overbred and you end up with hissing maniacs as a result.
Abys tend to be nicer, and Burmese nicer still.  You can be lucky with
individual cats, though.
