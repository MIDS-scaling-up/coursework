It's still doing it.  I reported a message as spam 10 minutes ago and
the check keeps coming back false.  What's funny is that message that
I'm testing with it the sample-spam.txt message from SpamAssassin and I
know it's been reported before.

Hi,

We were rolling out changes to TeS and catalogue servers over the last
two days. Any glitches you might have experienced would have been due to
the upgrades. The upgrades are now complete, and things are back to
normal. Several new features in TeS will provide better accuracy,
specially with regards to false-positives.

cheers,
vipul.
