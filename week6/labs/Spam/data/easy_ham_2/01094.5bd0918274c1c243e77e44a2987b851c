We were sitting here talking about Opera, and the fact that it's not free 
anymore (unless you want the scrollypollies),  and how that sucked and 
stuff, and someone said something about  nagware, and I misinterpretted it 
as snag ware, which mainly means, oh  yeh, right, I'm gonna buy this 
-eyeroll- where's someone with a key?  LOL  So who is it again who's on 
this list who's associated with Opera?  Why's the free one using the same 
LAME idea netzero, etc useD?   I know what kind of  costs are involved in 
creating software like this, and I understand everyone needs to eat, but 
if someone can get netscape for free, and opera isn't free, then, hmmm...  
I imagine this email is going to bring some bricks down on my head, but 
well, go for it, I gots my helmet.  (:

P.S. GregB, you there?  (:
