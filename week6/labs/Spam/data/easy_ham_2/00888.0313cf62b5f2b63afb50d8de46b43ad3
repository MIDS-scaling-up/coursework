> (or who are offspring of Wilt)

My bad.  Wilt, even if he had media
exposure that major studs only dream
about, was just another example of
natural selection, and doesn't even
come close to livestock potency.

1) I rather doubt that most of his
20,000 women bothered to check the
rebounding records of his cousins
and uncles and whatnot (how old is
basketball, in generations?) and
compared them with their own kin's.

2) Let's give Mr. Chamberlain the
benefit of the doubt and suppose he
sired twins with each mate.  40,000
lifetime production compares poorly
with a holstein bull.
