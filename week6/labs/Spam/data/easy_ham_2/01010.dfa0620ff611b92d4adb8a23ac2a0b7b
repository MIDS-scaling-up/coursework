Yeah, I was thinking of the G4 keyboard when I wrote this. Otherwise lousy
feel and key placement, though. (That's why I'm holding on to my IBM Model
M Space Saver. Once I get an PS2 to USB converter, I expect it will
outlive several generations of computer hardware).

Very good for sticking in USB fobs into, though. CRTs/LCD panels are even 
better for that, though.

I think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the 
keyboard issue.
