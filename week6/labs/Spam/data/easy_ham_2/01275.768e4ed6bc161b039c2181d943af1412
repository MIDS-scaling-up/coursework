**Scraping**:  I've read this before, but it's worth pointing to: Jon
Udell on <a href=http://www.byte.com/documents/s=493/byt20010214s0005/index.htm>SSL
Proxying</a>.

 the browser's secure traffic flows to Proxomitron. It decrypts that
 traffic, so you can see it in the log window, and then re-encrypts it to
 the destination server. Coming back the other way, it decrypts the
 server's responses, so you can see them in the log window, then
 re-encrypts them to complete the secure loop back to the browser.  It's
 really quite amazing, and amazingly useful. Automation tasks that used to
 look like more trouble than they were worth -- for example, driving a
 HotMail or E*Trade account from a script -- suddenly look easy.
