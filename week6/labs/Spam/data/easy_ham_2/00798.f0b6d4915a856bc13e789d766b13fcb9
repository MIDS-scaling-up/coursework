Just ignore the laws completely. You cannot win the legal way, because the
geek is a minority, and even not a lobby-toting minority at that. You
Cannot Win That Way. Really.

We need an uncensorable, hardened P2P infrastructure to distribute such
staples as open source software.  Software patents are tragedy of the
commons all over again. The collateral damage done by pirating is a
complete footnote in comparison to the radioactive glass iron-fisted IP
rights enforcement habitually produces.
