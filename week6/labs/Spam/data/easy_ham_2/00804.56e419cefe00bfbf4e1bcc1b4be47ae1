It doesn't really matter since they're about to merge. If you're into
PVRs though, Dish just came out with the "721" receiver. No monthly
fee for it (unlike Tivo, etc) and it can record two things at once while
you watch a third program previously recorded. Also has 120GB hard drive
and rumor has it a Broadcom chip in there to support the new encoding
system expected to be put into place a couple years after the merger.

(oh and the 721 is based on Linux if that matters)
