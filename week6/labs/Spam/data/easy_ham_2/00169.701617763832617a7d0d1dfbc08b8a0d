When I was in school they pushed Irish down my throat. I developed a hatred
for Irish. I did French for 3 years and German for 6 months, I could
(almost) hold a basic conversation. I am proud of the fact that I don't know
one word of Irish.

I am the evil one, you will respect my authoritai ;--)

Sorry, but I couldn't resist, I must say that mails like this really impress
me. coz I have pretty much no Irish at all, although my wee Girl starts
Gaelscoil in September so there hope for me yet :)

Much Respect to the Gaeilgors out there.

Can someone translate this for me? Lost all sense of Irish when moved
over the border about 10 years ago. Not by choice mind you :-(
