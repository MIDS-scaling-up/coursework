Maybe sf.net should provide automated (how much more automated can it
get? Well, maybe automatic one-click setup and instructions for those
who can't read manuals and a place in which to drop gpg keys) apt-rpm
(and maybe apt-deb though debian seems to package most stuff anyway)
repositories. If it was one big repository for "stable" releases and
each could have their own for "development" or "testing" releases. You
handled your own repo and they did a nightly stable update for example.
Also it should check that no-one can manage to put in a package with the
same name as another one or otherwise sabotage the thing.

(hmm, and I suppose the good sigmonster may deserve a cookie, too..)
