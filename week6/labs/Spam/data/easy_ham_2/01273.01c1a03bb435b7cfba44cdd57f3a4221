oops.  OK, now fixed; I've updated b2_4_0 to match what I wanted,
accordingly.  As a result, mass-checks do *NOT* need to be restarted as
the code and rules are the same as they were on HEAD.

cvs tag spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b

So, in full, here's the changes that are in spamassassin_pre_2_4_0b that
were not there before the branch:

  - rules fixed: HTTP_ESCAPED_HOST, HTTP_CTRL_CHARS_HOST.  they were too
    lax and caused FPs

  - Matt's faster HTML parser

  - commented rules un-commented again

  - a doco fix for spamd


and, for completeness, the relevant changes since Saturday:

  - the INSTALL file ;)

  - CALL_NOW now starts on a word boundary

  - Added examples to -R docs
  
  - Added Habeas HIL lookup

  - bug 385: spamcheck.py should handle 4xx errors -- full mailboxes etc.
    -- with EX_TEMPFAIL. patch from ckd-spamassassin@ckdhr.com
    (Christopher Davis) applied.

  -  made spamcheck.py use exit code 75 if it cannot connect to spamd,
     fixes bug 655

  - spamd/spamd.raw: fixed bug 704: spamd was not able to unlink pid file
    with -u arg

  - Makefile.PL: installing to random dirs now works fine

  - move MAILER_DAEMON into 70_cvs_rules_under_test.cf since it has been
    improved remove extraneous mass-check line for DATE_YEAR_ZERO_FIRST

  - spamassassin.raw: merged -Z with -D

  - removed eff.org from whitelists, as per Marc's request

  - mass-check: added versioning and date to mass-check output

  - bug 658: ok_locales set to 'en' by default. changed to 'all', users
    will have to customise for themselves.   Made many tests which trigger
    FPs on mail in ISO-2022-JP charsets, meta rules depending on
    __ISO_2022_JP_DELIM.

  - fixed phrase-freq code for vastly better performance

  - rules/50_scores.cf: changed LISTBUILDER score back to -5.0

  - lib/Mail/SpamAssassin/HTML.pm: catch background images in uri code
    catch additional types of web bugs

  - rules/20_body_tests.cf: change CASHCASHCASH to meta rule to avoid
    Japanese false matches, revise spam phrases descriptions to be clearer
    (since a few are now basically compensation tests (please don't move
    them to the compensation file))

  - fixed bug in MIME_SUSPECT_NAME: text/plan attachments called foo.html
    were triggering.

  - revise HTML comment tests to use HTML parser

  - revise MAILER_DAEMON rule (get rid of some spam matches without losing
    any nonspam matches)

  - raise some negative scores that are way too low

  - remove "Friend" from DEAR_SOMETHING since it overlaps with DEAR_FRIEND
    and can match "dear friend" in middle of sentence too much

  - require "Dear Friend" to start the paragraph

  - add new HTML tests for font colors and faces, reduce number of
    different eval functions needed for HTML tests

--j.
