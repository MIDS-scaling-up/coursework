>>From Egg to Drummies: 10 Weeks From Farm to Food
By  Larry Barrett

http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,3959,369038,00.asp

My breasts have been halved, breaded and shipped to their current
resting-place on a shelf in a supermarket in Denver. My legs should be
arriving in Moscow any time now. All my feathers have been processed and are
now being eaten by cattle somewhere in Texas. My blood and bones have been
rendered for cat food, fertilizer and who-knows- what else. My wings have
been seasoned with barbecue sauce and served with a side of ranch dressing
and celery at some bar and grill in New York City. My feet? Well, they're
headed to Asia where I'm told they're something of a delicacy.

So, a couple of things intrigued me about this byline, and its associated
main article:
And On the 47th Day, This Chicken Went to Market
By  Debbie Gage

- I had no idea how much computer controls played into the raising of
livestock
- I had no idea how fast a chicken is raised these days

It also strikes me that it will not be very long before livestock is
genetically engineered to be dumber and meatier, and better adapted to
living in industrial conditions.
