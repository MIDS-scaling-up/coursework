II. BUGTRAQ SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OpenSSL SSLv2 Malformed Client Key Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5363
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5363
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported in some versions of
OpenSSL.

When initiating an OpenSSL session, some information is shared between the
client and the server, including key data. The reported vulnerability lies
in the handling of the client key value during the negotiation of the
SSLv2 protocol.

A malicious client may exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a
malformed key to the vulnerable server. Careful exploitation may result in
execution of arbitrary code as the server process, and the attacker
gaining local access to the vulnerable system. More primitive attacks may
result in the server process crashing, possibly producing a denial of
service condition.

The consequences of exploitation may vary with the nature of the
application using OpenSSL.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

2. Abyss Web Server HTTP GET Request Directory Contents Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5345
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5345
Summary:

Abyss Web Server is a freely available personal web server. It is
maintained by Aprelium Technologies and runs on Microsoft Windows
operating systems, as well as Linux.

A vulnerability has been reported for Abyss Web Server 1.0.3 running on a
Microsoft Windows platform. It is possible for an attacker to make a
request such that the contents of the specified directory are revealed.

The vulnerability occurs due to the manner in which excessive '/'
characters are handled in web requests. An attacker making a GET request
followed by 256 '/' characters will cause Abyss Web Server to return an
error page containing the directory listing of the specified directory.

An attacker may be able to use this information to launch further,
potentially damaging attacks, against a vulnerable system.

3. DotProject User Cookie Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5347
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5347
Summary:

dotproject is web-based project management software, written in PHP.  It
is designed to run on Unix and Linux variants.

dotproject is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to bypass
authentication and gain administrative access to the software.

This may be accomplished by submitting a maliciously crafted 'user_cookie'
value either manually or via manipulation of URI parameters.  For example,
the attacker may manually craft a cookie with a 'user_cookie' value of 1
and submit it to the project management system.  An attacker may also
submit a malicious web request with the 'user_cookie' URI parameter set to
1.  In both instances, the attacker will gain administrative access to the
project management system.

This problem is due to the software relying on the 'user_cookie' value to
authenticate the user.

4. OpenSSL SSLv3 Session ID Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5362
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5362
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL. The vulnerability affects
SSLv3 session IDs.

When initiating contact with SSLv3 servers, clients and servers alike
exchange information. Session information is stored in a session key with
a unique session ID.

Reportedly when a an oversized SSL version 3 session ID is supplied to a
client from a malicious server, it is possible to overflow a buffer on the
remote system. This could result in key memory areas on the vulnerable,
remote system being overwritten, including stack frame data.

An attacker may be able to take advantage of this vulnerability to execute
malicious code on a vulnerable SSLv3 client machine.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

5. phpBB2 Gender Mod Remote SQL Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5342
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5342
Summary:

phpBB2 is an open-source web forum application that is written in PHP and
backended by a number of database products. It will run on most Unix and
Linux variants, as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

Gender Mod is a modification for phpBB2 which allows the association of a
gender with a given user profile. A SQL injection vulnerability has been
reported in this mod.

A malicious user may modify the specified value for 'gender' when updating
their profile. It is possible to include additional SQL statements in this
string, and subvert the SQL statement used to update the user profile.

It has been reported possible to gain administrative access to the phpBB2
site through exploitation of this issue. Other attacks may be possible,
including the ability to view sensitive database information or to modify
additional information stored in the database.

6. ShoutBox Form Field HTML Injection Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5354
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5354
Summary:

shoutBOX is web-based user feedback software.  It is written in PHP and
runs on Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating
systems.

ShoutBox does not sufficiently sanitize HTML tags from input supplied via
form fields.  In particular, the user website URL field of the feedback
form is not sanitized of HTML tags.

Attackers may exploit this lack of input validation to inject arbitrary
HTML and script code into pages that are generated by the script.  This
may result in execution of attacker-supplied code in the web client of a
user who visits such a page.  HTML and script code will be executed in the
security context of the site hosting the software.

This condition may be exploited to hijack web content or potentially steal
cookie-based authentication credentials.

7. Sympoll File Disclosure Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5360
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5360
Summary:

Sympoll is web-based voting booth software.  It is implemented in PHP and
will run on most Unix and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Sympoll is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to disclose
the contents of arbitrary webserver readable files.  This vulnerability is
only present on hosts which are running the vulnerable version of the
software and have the PHP 'register_globals' directive enabled.  The
source of this vulnerability is reported to be insufficient integrity
checking of variables.

The vendor has stated that this issue is only believed to affect Sympoll
version 1.2.

Exploitation of this issue on Microsoft Windows operating systems may
potentially expose arbitrary system files since webservers typically run
in the SYSTEM context.

8. OpenSSL ASN.1 Parsing Error Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5366
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5366
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A remotely exploitable denial of service condition has been reported in
the OpenSSL ASN.1 library.

This vulnerability is due to parsing errors and affects SSL, TLS, S/MIME,
PKCS#7 and certificate creation routines.  In particular, malformed
certificate encodings could cause a denial of service to server and client
implementations which depend on OpenSSL.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

9. William Deich Super SysLog Format String Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5367
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5367
Summary:

super is an open source set-uid root utility that allows for a similar
functionality to that of the sudo utility. It is written for use on Linux
and Unix variant operating systems.

super is prone to a format string vulnerability. This problem is due to
incorrect use of the syslog() function to log error messages. It is
possible to corrupt memory by passing format strings through the
vulnerable logging function. This may potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary locations in memory with attacker-specified values.

The vulnerability is a result of compiling super with syslog support. Due
to an error in the file, error.c, users that are not in the super
configuration file will still be able to execute code with root
privileges.

Successful exploitation of this issue may allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary instructions with root privileges.

10. Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload Plain Text Password Storage Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5369
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5369
Summary:

Frederic Tyndiuk Eupload is a small script designed to facilitate
uploading of files to a remote server. It is written in Perl and should
work with Microsoft Windows and Linux and Unix variant operating systems.

A problem with Eupload 1.0 may make it possible for remote attackers to
gain access to sensitive information.

Eupload does not cryptographically protect stored passwords. Passwords
contained in the configuration file, password.txt, are stored in plain
text. They may be read by simply viewing the file. The file, password.txt,
is stored in a web accessible location and is, itself, accessible for
retrieval. Thus it is trivial for an attacker to obtain user passwords and
abuse the Eupload service.

This problem could allow an attacker to gain access to the passwords to
protected resources.

11. Util-linux File Locking Race Condition Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5344
Remote: No
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5344
Summary:

The util-linux package is a set of commonly used system utilities such as
'chfn' and 'chsh'.  It is included with many Linux distributions.

A race condition has been reported in code shared by the util-linux
utilities.  The condition is related to file locking.  Failure to check
for the existence of a lockfile prior to sensitive operations may, under
specific circumstances, open a window of opportunity for attack.  The
util-linux utilities often write to sensitive files such as /etc/passwd/.
Attackers may exploit the condition to inject arbitrary data into these
files to elevate privileges.

The reported attacks are complex, time dependent and require specific
circumstances such as system administrator interaction and a large passwd
file.

Red Hat Linux is known to ship with util-linux as a core component.
Other distributions, those that are derived from Red Hat in particular,
may also be vulnerable.

It should be noted that the utilities included with the shadow-utils
package (shipped with SuSE Linux) are not vulnerable.

12. OpenSSL Kerberos Enabled SSLv3 Master Key Exchange Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5361
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5361
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol. It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc.. It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

A vulnerability has been reported for OpenSSL 0.9.7 pre-release versions.

This vulnerability is present only when Kerberos is enabled for a system
using SSL version 3.

When initiatiating contact between a SSLv3 server, master keys are
exchanged between the client and the server. When an oversized master key
is supplied to a SSL version 3 server by a malicious client, it may cause
a buffer to overflow on the vulnerable system. As a result, stack memory
on the vulnerable server will become corrupted. This could enable the
attacker to take control of the SSLv3 server process and cause it to
execute malicious, attacker supplied code.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

13. OpenSSL ASCII Representation Of Integers Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5364
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5364
Summary:

OpenSSL is an open source implementation of the SSL protocol.  It is used
by a number of other projects, including but not restricted to Apache,
Sendmail, Bind, etc..  It is commonly found on Linux and Unix based
systems.

Remotely exploitable buffer overflow conditions have been reported in
OpenSSL.  This issue is due to insufficient checking of bounds with
regards to ASCII representations of integers on 64 bit platforms.  It is
possible to overflow these buffers on a vulnerable system if overly large
values are submitted by a malicious attacker.

Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow execution of arbitrary code
with the privileges of the vulnerable application, service or client.

Oracle reports that CorporateTime Outlook Connector is only vulnerable
under Microsoft Windows 98, NT, 2K, and XP.

** This vulnerability was originally part of BID 5353, Multiple OpenSSL
Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities. It has now been reissued as a separate
vulnerability.

14. ParaChat Phantom User Denial Of Service Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5370
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 31 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5370
Summary:

ParaChat is a web-based chatting system.  It is available for most Unix
and Linux variants as well as Microsoft Windows operating systems.

ParaChat chat servers are prone to a denial of service condition.

If a user has left the webpage for a chat room using the Back or Forward
buttons of their browser in lieu of logging out, their account will still
be logged into the chat room until it times out 15 minutes later.  A
malicious user may do this repeatedly as different users to overload the
chat server with "phantom" users.  A denial of service may be the result.

15. OpenSSH Trojan Horse Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5374
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5374
Summary:

OpenSSH is a freely available implementation of the SSH client-server
protocol. It is distributed and maintained by the OpenSSH team.

Reportedly, the server hosting openssh, ftp.openbsd.org, was compromised
recently. It has been reported that the intruder made modifications to the
source code of openssh to include trojan horse code. Downloads of the
openssh source code from ftp.openbsd.org between July 30, 2002 and July
31, 2002 likely contain the trojan code.

The trojan code appears to be included in the file, bf-test.c. Reports say
that the trojan will run once upon compilation of openssh. The trojan
process is named 'sh' or the compiling user's default shell. Once executed
the trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32 on port 6667. The trojan
will then wait for one of three commands. A connection to the specified
address is attempted once every hour.

'D' will cause the trojan to execute '/bin/sh'. 'M' will cause the trojan
to respawn and 'A' will terminate the trojan process. It is highly
probable that this trojan will give remote root access to vulnerable
systems.

The following sites also have been reported to carry the trojaned version of openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz:
ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp.usa.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/
ftp://ftp1.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/OpenSSH/

It is not known whether other sites are affected as well.

FreeBSD has reported the following MD5 checksum information. The following
is the MD5 checksum of the trojaned version of openssh: MD5
(openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 3ac9bc346d736b4a51d676faa2a08a57

The following is the MD5 checksum of openssh in the FreeBSD ports
directory: MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8

Note that a different checksum does not mean the backdoor does not exist.

*** The OpenSSH team has released an advisory. Fixed versions of openssh
are available for download since 1300 UTC August 1, 2002. The following
MD5 checksum information was provided for fixed versions of openssh:

MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz) = 459c1d0262e939d6432f193c7a4ba8a8
MD5 (openssh-3.4p1.tar.gz.sig) = d5a956263287e7fd261528bb1962f24c
MD5 (openssh-3.4.tgz) = 39659226ff5b0d16d0290b21f67c46f2
MD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz) = 9d3e1e31e8d6cdbfa3036cb183aa4a01
MD5 (openssh-3.2.2p1.tar.gz.sig) = be4f9ed8da1735efd770dc8fa2bb808a

16. Bharat Mediratta Gallery Remote File Include Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5375
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 01 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5375
Summary:

Gallery is an open source web based photo album. It is written in PHP and
is available for Linux and Unix variant as well as Microsoft Windows
operating systems.

Gallery is prone to an issue which may allow remote attackers to include
arbitrary files located on remote servers. This issue is present in the
following PHP script files provided with Gallery: errors/configmode.php
errors/needinit.php errors/reconfigure.php errors/unconfigured.php
captionator.php

An attacker may exploit this by supplying a path to a file, 'init.php', on
a remote host as a value for the 'GALLERY_BASEDIR' parameter.

If the remote file is a PHP script, this may allow for execution of
attacker-supplied PHP code with the privileges of the webserver.
Successful exploitation may provide local access to the attacker.

17. John G. Myers MUnpack Malformed MIME Encoded Message Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5385
Remote: No
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5385
Summary:

John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been reported for munpack 1.5.
Reportedly, it is possible to cause munpack to crash when it receives a
malformed email or NNTP news article.

As this vulnerability is the result of a buffer overflow condition, it may
be possible for an attacker to cause munpack to execute malicious attacker
supplied code. This has not, however, been confirmed.

18. Dispair Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5392
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 30 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5392
Summary:

Dispair is a web-based .tar.gz archive viewer.  It is written in Perl and
is available for Linux and Unix operating systems.

Dispair fails to sufficiently validate user-supplied input before it is
passed to the shell via the Perl open() function.  A remote attacker may
exploit this condition by injecting arbitrary commands into CGI parameters
in a request to the vulnerable script.

The result of successful exploitation is that attackers may potentially
exploit this issue to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying shell
with the privileges of the webserver process.

19. Mailreader Session Hijacking Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5393
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5393
Summary:

Mailreader is an open source project which allows POP3 mail access through
a web interface. Mailreader is implemented in Perl, and should work under
Microsoft Windows, Linux and other Unix based operating systems.

A vulnerability has been reported in some versions of Mailreader. It may
be possible for a remote attacker to hijack the session of a legitimate
user of the system. This may result in access to sensitive information, or
the ability to send mail and otherwise function as the legitimate user.

Full exploit details are not available. It is possible that this
vulnerability results from session information being tracked through CGI
parameters, which may be trivially spoofed by a remote user. This
possibility has not, however, been confirmed.

20. John G. Myers MPack/MUnpack Malformed Filename Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5386

Date Published: Aug 02 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5386
Summary:

John G. Myers mpack/munpack is a pair of utilities to encode and decode
MIME format email. Versions are available for Linux and Unix variant
operating systems as well as Microsoft DOS.

A vulnerability has been reported for mpack/munpack 1.5. Reportedly, it is
possible to cause munpack to create files outside of a designated
directory. When mpack/munpack receives a MIME encoded message with an
attachment that refers to a file, using a '../' sequence followed by the
filename, it may decode the attachment outside of a designated directory.

The impact of this vulnerability is limited as it has been reported that
munpack will only accept a single '../' sequence and will not overwrite
any existing files.

21. Fake Identd Client Query Remote Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
BugTraq ID: 5351
Remote: Yes
Date Published: Jul 29 2002 12:00AM
Relevant URL:
http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/5351
Summary:

Fake Identd is an open source Ident server designed to return the same
information to all incoming requests. It is implemented by Tomi Ollila,
and available for Linux and a number of other Unix based operating
systems.

Reportedly, some versions of Fake Identd fail to properly handle long
client requests. A specially formatted request split across multiple TCP
packets may cause an internal buffer to overflow. Reportedly, execution of
arbitrary code as the Fake Identd server process is possible.

Fake Identd is designed to drop privileges. However, it has also been
reported that this behavior is flawed in some versions. As a result,
exploitation may result in the execution of code with root privileges.
