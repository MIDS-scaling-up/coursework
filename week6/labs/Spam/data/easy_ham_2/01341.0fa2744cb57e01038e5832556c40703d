Doesn't defeat this system at all. If you see that once, feed it into 
your bayesian classifier, and it classifies the URLs used for the 
images. Then next time it sees one, it knows with almost 100% accuracy 
that an email with one of those URLs is definitely spam.

In many ways this is like Razor, which is why I'm hacking on a 
distributed system to do this, to see if it's feasible to scale it globally.
