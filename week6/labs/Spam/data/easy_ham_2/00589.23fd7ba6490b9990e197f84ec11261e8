Isn't that why you have whitelisting?

My question for the trust system is this. I signed up for a free account

on some website that gives me free access to a large compilation of
data, 
and in so doing have subscribed myself to their mailing list. The
mailing 
includes a list of new articles and books and so forth as well as a few 
links to their book store.

This is consistently flagged as spam, even though I *agreed* to see it, 
and I *want* to see what new articles there are, since some of them
might 
be interesting. Thus, since it is certifiably *not* spam (it even 
includes a link to terminate your account), I revoke it. Even so, the 
next mail is still flagged as spam.

Who is losing a trust rating here? If it is not unsolicited commercial
e- mail, it should not be reported by Razor as spam -- correct?
