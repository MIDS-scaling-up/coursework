 Hmm. It's even worse than using a text editor on a file.

 Don't buy it.

 shift-alt-s should start a shell, alt-d should maximise a window
vertically, alt-q should close a window, alt-w should shade it. These I've
used for about eight years, and I'm not about to change them now.

 Stuff like alt-1 to go to workspace-1, I love - it just appeared in
windowmaker about six years back, and I've also gotten used to it.

 Wierdly, I've gone back to sawfish & gnome 1.4 - and the keybindings
still don't work. It's not fair.
