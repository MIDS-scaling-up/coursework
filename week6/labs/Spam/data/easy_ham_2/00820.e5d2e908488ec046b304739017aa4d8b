satisfaire vous rends ce drole singe global d'ane.

Shlepy>You kick his sister in the jaw.

Frenchie>Je suis dans l'enfer.

Shelpy>Dont he speak funny folks? yep them French are mighty bizzare.
They do things very differently over there. For instace you know why
they dont have fireworks at Euro Disney?

Frenchie> Puisque nous soufflerions plutt nos ttes outre de qu'observe un
infrieur brut classer la clbration amricaine?

Shlepy>What ever ya said, nope..Because every time they shoot
them off, the French try to surrender.

Frenchie>Etant donn le choix entre les Allemands et vous que je
nettoierais heureusement versez les stalles dans les camps alors doivent
aller  vos parcs d'amusement.

Shlepy> Aint he the continental one....Speaking of global
politics....Three guys, an Englishman, a Frenchman and an American are out
walking along the beach together one day. They come across a lantern and a
genie pops out of it.  "I will give you each one wish, " says the genie.
The American says, "I am a farmer, my dad was a farmer, and my son will
also farm. I want the land to be forever fertile in America." With a blink
of the genie's eye, 'FOOM'  -  the land in America was forever made
fertile for farming.  The Frenchman was amazed, so he said, "I want a wall
around France, so that no one can come into our precious country."  Again,
with a blink of the Genie's eye, 'POOF'  -  there was a huge wall around
France.  The Englishman asks, "I'm very curious. Please tell me more about
this wall.  The Genie explains, "Well, it's about 150 feet high, 50 feet
thick and nothing can get in or out."  The Englishman says, "Fill it up
with water."

Fenchie>Plutt nous devrions nous noyer que mangent la cuisine anglaise.

Shlpey> Them French, you dont know what they are on about but damn it sure
sounds romantic. And you knwo they are great lovers those french are. A
psychology professor decided to study the way in which different people
from different parts of Europe have sex with sheep. He traveled first to
Wales, where he asks a farmer to explain his method: "Well, boyo, I put
her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with me velcro gloves,
and we're well away. Tidy!"  The professor tries Scotland next "Hoots an'
toots man, I put her back legs down my nice green wellies, grab her with
me velcro gloves, and we're  well away. Och aye tha noo!"  The professor
moves on to Germany: "Well, I find the most efficient way is to grab her
with my velcro gloves, and we're well away. The professor is noticing a
pattern developing, so he decides to try France, and then end his
investigation.  He stops a bloke by the Eiffel tower named Pierre, and
asks him to explain the French method: "Well monsieur, I put her back legs
down my nice green wellies, sling her front legs over me shoulders, and
that's all there is to it!" The professor is excited to have found some
national variation and tells Pierre that this is different to the methods
of the Scots, Welsh and Germans. "How do they do it then?" asks Pierre,
and the professor explains. Pierre on hearing the explanation walks of
disgusted. "What! No kissing?"

Frenchie>Voil. J'ai stopp.

Shlepy> Hey, where you going with the sheep, we need them for the next
act....

A little traveling music maestro.
