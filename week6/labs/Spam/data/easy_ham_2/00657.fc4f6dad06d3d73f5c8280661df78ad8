  Based on your description the whole thing would be 1 part.

  If your mail contains a fwd of a mail *inline* with mime boundaries, 
  then your mail is all consindered to be just text.  If you fwd
  the mail as attachment, the attachment is considered to be a separate
  part  - but the attachment is not broken down further for
  various reasons as mentioned before on this list.

  Its in the source code.  
  You should also see 'method 5' in your debug logs.
