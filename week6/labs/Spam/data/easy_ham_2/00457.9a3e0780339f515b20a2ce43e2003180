In my experience Windows will change the hardware clock the first time
you boot into it after the clocks have gone forward/back an hour.  This
will only happen twice a year. How to stop it, I have not checked (I
just switch the clock back an hour from within windows after such a
reboot).  Is there a GMT windows timezone?

With ntp, it is a big no-no (afaik) to have other programs messing with
the clock as it will put ntp's calculations of drift etc., out. (maybe
this only applies to chrony, which is what I use).  If the windows
change only moves forward an hour, and you shift back an hour, maybe ntp
will be (relatively) ok (depends if all the remaining digits of time
precision are left unchanged, probably they aren't exactly).
