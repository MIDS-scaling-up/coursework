Group Ltd, [4]DynDNS, and [5]Stonehenge Consulting are hosting a great
party. 15 gaming class computers will be networked together as the base
of a killer [6]Quake 3 Arena fragging. The bar will be open for your
drinking pleasure. The party is open to all OSCON attendees and
participants. Come rub elbows with the best programmers on earth and
simultaneously destroy them in Quake."

The [7]LAN Party will be held on Thursday, 8pm - ??, at Quinn's bar (main
lobby, Sheraton East Tower at the conference).
