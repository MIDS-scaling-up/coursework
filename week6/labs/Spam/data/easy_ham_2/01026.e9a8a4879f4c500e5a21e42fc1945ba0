That might work easily enough for reasonably rigid
solids that can be positioned and fingerprinted. I
think it would be more difficult for other items.
Like a sweater. The exact pattern of threads is never

problem of automatically capturing any object's look,
adequately to uniquely identifying it later, is still
open research.
