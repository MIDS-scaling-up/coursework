I have a version that's working now. I'll try it a couple of days and 
check it during daylight. Basically I added an agument to 
ClearCurrent and updated all callers to slap in $ftoc(curLine). I 
also flipped the order in  Msg_Change to ClearCurrent $prevline after 
the Mh_SetCur. For some reason it barfs when Marking many messages 
Unread. I'll check that tomorrow.

G'night.
