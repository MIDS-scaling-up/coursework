Nice theory and all, but s/India/France/g and the statements hold just
as true, yet France is #12 in the UN's HDI ranking, not #124.

I'm not convinced that that classical liberalism is a good solution
for countries in real difficulty.  See Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel for
Economics) on the FMI's failed remedies.  Of course googling on
"Stiglitz FMI" only brings up links in Spanish and French.  I guess
that variety of spin is non grata in many anglo circles.
