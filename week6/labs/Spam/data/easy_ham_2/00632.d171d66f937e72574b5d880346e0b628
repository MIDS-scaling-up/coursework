Sounds like you're solving the wrong problem.  If untrusted strangers
are relaying spam through your qmail server, it's a fair bet that
you've seriously botched your qmail config (like forgetting to create
an rcpthosts file or something).

Anyway, if you insist on using razor to resolve this problem, I
would suggest tossing qmail-scanner <http://qmail-scanner.sf.net/>
and SpamAssassin <http://www.spamassassin.org/> into the mix as well.
The former provides the qmail-integration framework on which the latter
does its work (including razor-check invocations).

Fair warning: It'll be far more resource-intensive than simply denying
relaying privileges to everyone except the folks you trust.  To find
out how to do that, go to <http://www.qmail.org/> (which, incidentally,
should be your first stop for all things qmail) and search for "qmail
newbie's guide to relaying".
