Has anybody on the list installed/used this distro? If so wouldn't mind a bit 
of help.

 Burnt the ISO's from the latest Linux Format magazine. Took a couple of 
attempts to install but got there. My problem - I have a standard dial-up 
modem and the installation gives you the network card setup so internet 
download is out of the question, but, I installed the Stage3 tarball which 
puts the .tgz files on your harddrive. 

 So methinks, I have the software there and all I need to do is install so as 
1) get the necessary programmes to connect to the net and 2) install any 
other programmes I might need.

 What actually happens is that if, for example, I attempt to install the KDE 
package, the system goes looking for any dependencies on the net despite the 
fact that the dependencies reside on my hard drive. Obviously I can't install 
anything.

 Have checked all docs on the web page and nothing deals with a standard 
dial-up modem or how to tell the package manager to look for the dependencies 
on the hard drive.

 Anybody able to help me here?

 Thanks in anticipation.
