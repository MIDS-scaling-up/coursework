PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT:

The new .NAME domain extension is currently being released to the general public. Unlike the original .COM and .NET domain names, the new .NAME domain was specifically created for individuals such as yourself. The .NAME domain appears in the format: FirstName.LastName.NAME For example, if your name is Monica Smith, then you can register a name such as monica.smith.name Technology experts predict that personalized domain names will soon be used as international identifiers much the same was that phone numbers are used today. For a limited time, you can pre-register your unique .NAME domain for only $10 (plus applicable registry fees) at: http://www.namesforeveryone.com
