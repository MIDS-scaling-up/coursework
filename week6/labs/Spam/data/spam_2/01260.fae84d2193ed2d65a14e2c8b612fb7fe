It tastes great and feels great too!  I am so glad I took a chance and ordered.  Blessings to all of you.”

Not anymore with the Temple “3”.  It really amazes me how this stuff tastes like the Lebanese and blonde stuff I used to smoke in the 70’s.  I am very satisfied with all of your products.  I like them a lot and will be a customer for life for sure.  Whoever makes this stuff is an ARTIST at it.  Who would have thought?!”

  Equivalence Tablets  &  Dragon Wing Remedy Spray
    (Hei Ping Shun)           (Hei Long Chibang)

PLEASE NOTE:

While it is true that all physiological traumas and injuries are unique and that no product can arbitrarily eliminate all of the pain and discomfort in all people all of the time, the combination of Equivalence Tablets (Hei Ping Shun) and Dragon Wing Remedy (Hei Long Chibang) remedial botanicals does guarantee to at the least:

1.  Significantly reduce discomfort and pain!
(In many instances most, if not all, traumas and distress can be eliminated!)

2.  Significantly increase mobility and strength ratio.

Equivalence Tablets & Dragon Wing Spray Remedials are comprised of entirely natural botanical factors.
