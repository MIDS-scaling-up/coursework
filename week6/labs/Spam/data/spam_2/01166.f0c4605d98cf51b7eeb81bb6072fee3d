Well, LazyTraders, 

Our Chatroom continues to get more profitable every week, here is what happened this week;

Every day the room averaged about $200,000 profit, and on Wednesday it produced $449,000 trading with 1000 shares.

If you were trading with 100 shares the results would have been $20,000 every day and $44,900 on Wednesday.

Mr G uses Fibonacci numbers and Elliott Waves and will teach you how to do the same thing.
