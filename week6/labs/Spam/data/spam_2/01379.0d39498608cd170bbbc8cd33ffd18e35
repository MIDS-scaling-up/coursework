Subject: Sitescooper: scoop websites onto your PalmPilot - Sitescooper
    automatically retrieves the stories from several news websites, trims off
    extraneous HTML, and converts them into iSilo or Palm DOC format for later
    reading on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've
    already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and
    3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very
    easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot,
    it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are
    included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat
    and Linux Today.  http://jmason.org/software/sitescooper/

Your category: http://topsitez.us/category-tab.htm?id=713164&d=spamassassin.taint.org

REACH A MILLION
Here is what you get:
1. We will continue to list your site in the TopSites directories.
2. We will show your listing more than a million times a year (guaranteed).

Let us introduce you (a million times!)
People often ask, "How can you guarantee to show my listing a million times? What if I am in an unpopular category?" It does not matter! Why? AutoSearch--our patent pending tool--continually displays renewed TopSites-us listings on our users’ PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We display TopSites-us listings more than 42 million times in an hour. That is why we can guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year. 

Save $40,000 in adverting 
It would cost you up to $40,000 to display your listing a million times at sites like MSN and Altavista. Googles charges up to $200,000 depending on your category. At TopSites we charge $5 a month!

Save $100 re-listing fee
Please do not let your listing expire. Our editors listed you as one of the top websites in your category without charge. If your listing expires, however, you may need to pay a $100 editorial review fee to get listed again. It can take a month for our editors to authorize a listing. And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings in your category. 

Only TopSites-us gives you: 
* Massive Reach: We display our listings billions of times a year. We guarantee to show your listing more than a million times a year.
* Cost-Effectiveness: This is the least expensive advertising you will ever buy. You want to bring lots of potential customers to your site in a cost-effective way. TopSites-us does exactly that! 
* Highly Targeted Leads: TopSites-us reaches customers when they are searching for what you are selling. That means high sales and low costs. More visitors become customers! 
* Highest Return on Investment: Independent research confirms that you get the highest ROI from online listings like TopSites-us. E-mail, banners and other forms of online advertising all have a lower ROI. And unlike direct mail, you pay nothing for mailing lists, printing or postage. No media buy returns better results than TopSites-us. 
* No-Risk: Cancel your listing any time for any reason--no questions asked!
* Hassle-Free: Change your listing anytime or even move it to a different category--for free--and your changes will instantly appear in the directory
 
"TopSites-us is the least expensive way I have found to bring buyers to my site. I have tried other online advertising companies and you beat everyone!" 
--P.A., President, Go Software (g-o.us) 

"TopSites-us makes my online marketing easy. I can change my message 24 hours a day so it is always up-to-date. And everyone who sees it is a pre-qualified prospect." 
--N.B., CEO, My News (my-news.org)
 
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 
Can I change my listing?
You can change your listing now or later. You can rewrite the headline and description before renewing. You can change the URL too—even to another website. 
Once we receive payment, we will send you instructions on how to change your listing whenever you like. (There’s no charge to do this.)

Can I change my category? 
Can I list my site in additional categories?
Can I list other sites too?
You can list as many sites in as many categories as you like. Each listing costs only $5 per month per category. Just go to www.topsitez.us. Click on the category links until you find the one you want (or search on your keywords). Click on the Add My Site link. Then type your listing. If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click unsubscribe to cancel it.

How much does a listing cost?
Can I renew for free?
It costs $5 a month to list your site in TopSites. We no longer offer any free listings. We will bill you $60 for 12 months. There are no additional costs. You can change your listing as often as you like for free. You can cancel your listing anytime and we will refund your remaining money.

How do I pay? 
You can pay with a U.S. check, money order or bank draft. Or you can pay by Visa, MasterCard or American Express. Simply select the option you prefer on the renewal form. (Unfortunately, we cannot cash overseas checks at this time.)

Who listed us?
When did our listing start?
We do not know. Sorry. We only began to track listing contacts and dates this year.

How much did we pay to be listed? 
Originally you couldn’t buy a listing--you had to wait for our editors to select you as one of the top sites in your category.

Do we have a contract with you?
We don’t ask our customers to sign contracts for a $5 a month service.

Can you call me and tell me more?
We are happy to answer all your questions by email but we don’t contact our customer by phone at this time. Sorry.

Can I still renew after your deadline?
We give our customers a month to renew so don’t worry too much about the deadline.

How do I see my listing? I couldn’t find it when I searched.
You can go to www.topsitez.us and click on the categories until you get to /Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Internet.
You can also see it at www.topsitez.us by entering two or more keywords from your listing into our search form. Since we have more than three million listings, you probably won’t find your listing by searching on only one word. And you definitely won’t find it if you search on words that are not in your listing. 

What keywords display my listing? 
How do I change them?
Every word in your listing is a keyword. Anytime someone searches on two or more words in your listing, we will display it. The only way to change your keywords is to change the headline or description of your listing.

How much traffic did you send us last year?
We don’t know. Sorry. We are working on adding this feature.

        <ol>
          <li>We will continue to list your site in the TopSites directory.</li>

<b>Let us introduce you (a million times)</b><br><br>
People often ask, &quot;How can you guarantee to show my listing a million times? 
What if I am in an unpopular category?&quot; It does not matter! Why?

 
  AutoSearch--our patent pending tool--continually displays

 
  renewed TopSites-us  
listings on 
our users’ PCs 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We display TopSites-us listings 
more than 42 million 
  times in an hour. That is why we can guarantee to show your listing more than a million 
  times a year. </p>

 
 
        <p> <b>Save $40,000 in adverting</b> <br>
          <br>
          It would cost you up to $40,000 to display your listing a million times 
          at sites like MSN and Altavista. Googles charges up to $200,000 depending 
          on your category. At TopSites we charge $5 a month!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Save $100 re-listing fee</b><br>
          <br>
          Please do not let your listing expire. Our editors listed you as one 
          of the top websites in your category without charge. If your listing 
          expires, however, you may need to pay a $100 editorial review fee to 
          get listed again. It can take a month for our editors to authorize a 
          listing. And they may not re-list you if there are too many listings 
          in your category. </p>

 
 
     <p><b>Only TopSites-us 
  gives you: </b> </p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li><i>Massive Reach:</i> We display our listings billions of times a year. 
    We guarantee to show <i>your</i> listing more than a million times a year.</li>

          <li> <b>Can I change my listing?</b><br>
            You can change your listing now or later. You can rewrite the headline 
            and description before renewing. You can change the URL too—even to 
            another website. <br>
            Once we receive payment, we will send you instructions on how to change 
            your listing whenever you like. (There’s no charge to do this.)<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Can I change my category? <br>
            Can I list my site in additional categories?<br>
            Can I list other sites too?</b><br>
            You can list as many sites in as many categories as you like. Each 
            listing costs only $5 per month per category. Just go to <a href="http://www.topsitez.us">www.topsitez.us</a>. 
            Click on the category links until you find the one you want (or search 
            on your keywords). Click on the Add My Site link. Then type your listing. 
            If your old listing was in the wrong category, you can click <a href="http://topsitez.us/cancel.htm?id=713164&d=jmason.org">unsubscribe</a> 
            to cancel it.<br>

          </li>
          <li> <b>How much does a listing cost?<br>
            Can I renew for free?</b><br>
            It costs $5 a month to list your site in TopSites. We no longer offer 
            any free listings. We will bill you $60 for 12 months. There are no 
            additional costs. You can change your listing as often as you like 
            for free. You can cancel your listing anytime and we will refund your 
            remaining money.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>How do I pay? </b> <br>
            You can pay with a check from any country. (Simply convert the amount 
            to your local currency.) Or you can pay by Visa, MasterCard or American 
            Express. Simply select the option you prefer on the renewal form.<br>

          </li>
          <li> <b>Who listed us?<br>
            When did our listing start?</b><br>
            We do not know. Sorry. We only began to store listing contacts and 
            dates this year.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>How much did we pay to get listed? </b><br>
            Originally you couldn’t buy a listing—you had to wait for our editors 
            to select you as one of the top sites in your category.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Do we have a contract with you?<br>
            </b>We don’t do contracts for a $5 service.<br>

          </li>
          <li> <b>Can you call me and tell me more?<br>
            </b>We are happy to answer all your questions by email but we don’t 
            contact our customer by phone at this time. Sorry.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>Can I still renew after your deadline?<br>
            </b>We give our customers a month to renew so don’t worry too much 
            about the deadline.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>How do I see my listing?<br>
            I couldn’t find it when I searched.</b><br>
            To save you time, I have included your listing at the end of this 
            email. Or you can see it on our website by clicking <a href="http://topsitez.us/category-tab.htm?id=713164&d=jmason.org">your 
            listing</a>. Or you can go to <a href="http://www.topsitez.us">www.topsitez.us</a> 
            and click on the categories until you get to /Top/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Linux/Projects/Internet.<br>
            You can also see it at <a href="http://www.topsitez.us">www.topsitez.us</a> 
            by entering two or more keywords from your listing into our search 
            form. Since we have more than three million listings, you probably 
            won’t find your listing by searching on only one word. And you definitely 
            won’t find it if you search on words that are not in your listing. 
            <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>What keywords display my listing? </b> <br>
            <b>How do I change them?</b><br>
            Every word in your listing is a keyword. Anytime someone searches 
            on two or more words in your listing, we will display it. The only 
            way to change your keywords is to change the headline or description 
            of your listing.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li> <b>How much traffic did you send us last year?</b><br>
            We don’t know. Sorry. We are working on adding this feature.

Sitescooper automatically retrieves the stories from several news websites, trims    off extraneous HTML, and converts them into iSilo or Palm DOC format for later    reading on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've already    read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2- and 3-level sites as well    as My-Netscape-style RSS sites. It's also very easy to add a new site to its list.    Even if you don't have a PalmPilot, it's still handy for simple website-to-text    conversion. Site files are included for many popular news sites including Slashdot,    LWN, Freshmeat and Linux Today.</font><br>
