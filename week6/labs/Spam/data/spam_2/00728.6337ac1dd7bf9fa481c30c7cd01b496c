Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time
mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level
marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most
important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The
pursuit of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their
friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is
fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't
yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of
income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell
you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard
of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the
information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type
"Send Info" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to
you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your
Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Looking4Money 

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And
it's FREE!
