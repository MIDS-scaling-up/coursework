dise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well position=
ed to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing C=
hinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted=
 by the Chinese government provide the company with an &quot;unfair advant=
age&quot; over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent licen=
se agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the=
 world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will e=
nable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Millio=
n within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancin=
