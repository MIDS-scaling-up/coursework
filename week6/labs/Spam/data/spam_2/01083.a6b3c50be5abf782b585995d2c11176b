June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or
placed by you or under your control:
"DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has
condemned the "fraudulent assertions" of two organizations, namely the
DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for
Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an
alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France-
Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to
countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by
representatives of either nation."
"A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the early
1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall
Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled
the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has
disputed." http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of
2/1/00)
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of
false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom
of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a
serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how
distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of
my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am
obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully
offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your
text will be set off (with "**") in color:
**DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in
the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000
miles south of Tahiti.**
(Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall
Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in
which case a reader may be misled.)
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern
Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific.
**However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the "fraudulent
assertions" of two organizations, ...**
(Comment: Just because the RMI government "...has condemned the
'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio...", does that make it true?
Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been
internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud,
abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every
financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to
serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for
the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign
invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their
own corrupt government?)
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the
Marshallese name for Wake Island),...**
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for
DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a "sister
nation" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is
not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a
deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the
sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and
irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources
anymore?)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and
the same could be said for DOM.
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged
investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.**
(Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people
of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands
and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for
perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, "...an article in Agence France-Presse"
has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands
government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not
now and never has been engaged in an "...investment scam...". We have
tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources
for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also
will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are
currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have
in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate
entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists
use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't
anybody check sources anymore?)
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries
against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of
either nation.**
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no "fraudulent claims" of
which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published
information. I would personally caution any "..countries against
acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."
nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that
effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any
RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the
credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral
sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the
Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his
will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will
happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of
lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and
they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their
jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.)
**A Honolulu-based attorney created the "Kingdom of EnenKio" in the
early 1990s.**
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu
in the early 1990s.)
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and
6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount
Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and
was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign
state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King
over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established
government as a limited constitutional monarchy.
**It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands
paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad
powers to act on his behalf.**
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted
brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the
post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a
Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific
instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from
Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the
people's behalf.
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and
ordered it nullified, which the "kingdom" has disputed.**
(Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an "agreement"? The
Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special
Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of
EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no
political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of
Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not
incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was
it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of
any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any
statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.)
Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more
research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion
of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before
arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you
to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents
mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace')
and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site.
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected
elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above
in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the
author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio'
correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request
for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author
regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio.
"Fantasy Island" -- "Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet
can take fraud to new frontiers" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December
10, 1998: "Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation
once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According
to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was
leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of
EnenKio," another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims
the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands."
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article
of December 24, 1998: "Fantasy Island", disconnected as of 2/1/00)
Response to the author: I am unable to locate the "Melchizedek press
release" you cited, indicating that "...Taongi was leased in 1997 under
a treaty with representatives of "the kingdom of EnenKio,...". Such an
act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal
authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall
Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to
publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a
suitable land base for its people to administer their form of
government.
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day
of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a
state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our
governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had
nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert
Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not
convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence.
This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of
landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to
Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount
Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction.
Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by
Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios.
Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter
case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of
Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr.
Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998,
the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of
the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll
(a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names).
For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is "...another only-in-
cyberspace country...", as you did in the above article, is not only a
completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign
of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive
intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your
journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be
proved accurate.
I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment
and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric
history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named
by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and
missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the
public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and
most of which are referenced or published at our official web address:
Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many
cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so
states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would
simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request
the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be
added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from
one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00).
"Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the
Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a
U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for
recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and
pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.
The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests
took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the
illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of
the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of
an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's
independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after
the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as
Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American
businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls,
which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."
Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward
facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet
since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced
text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very
serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke,
which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of
EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your
summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios
and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line
by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off
(with "**") in color:
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall
Islands of the western Pacific.**
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western
explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in
Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean.
The Author responds: "Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the
role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."
**After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional
chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part
of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll,
called Enenkio locally.**
Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific,
which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of
the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well
established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and,
having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese
invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak
atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
The Author responds: "I don't see much conflict between the two versions
here."
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.**
Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the
Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its
move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional
landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios.
The Author responds: "I will note this."
**The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993
acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment
by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.**
Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after
precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged
the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of
Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the
following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People.
**King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the
northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.**
Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death
in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994,
whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll,
ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited
constitutional monarchy.
The Author responds: "I will make the necessary corrections here."
**The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained
its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary
in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore
land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared
the Dominion of Melchizedek.**
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his
brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today.
To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have
nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since
HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak
atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10
atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story,
which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have
offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct
your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our
pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and
interest in this matter.
The Author responds: "I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's
Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources
& Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I
will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response,
Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the
next week or so." (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background:
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a "press release" on the
Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0
(discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, "Mr. Joseph Biglar,
Undersecretary", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His
Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or
state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the
said "press release" is indeed an official document.
The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that
representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King
Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right
and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons,
many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall
Islands.
Response to so-called "Press Release":
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the
Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also
unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an
unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon
Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the
U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report)
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall
Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio:
=C2=BB =C2=BB exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo
Convention (1933).
=C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate independent state by its
sovereign,
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987.
=C2=BB =C2=BB was established by way of a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many
other
states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek
=C2=BB =C2=BB has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over
islands
and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - "RMI geographical and political
boundaries."
=C2=BB =C2=BB exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional
and
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred
heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI
Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak
atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its
political
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and
seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of
Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the
Marshall Islands.
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall
Islands:
=C2=BB =C2=BB also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the
Montevideo
Convention (1933).
=C2=BB =C2=BB was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign
governments,
which included the United States, China and the USSR.
=C2=BB =C2=BB was also established under a public authority, the
Constitution
of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people.
=C2=BB =C2=BB has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of
anything that is not also public information and no such public

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the
Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements
or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands
which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility,
existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in
the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication
by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as
deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His
Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of
EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate
responsive measures.
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of
the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom
of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following
statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands,
then you decide for yourself:
"With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace
and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the
aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and
striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."
On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom
of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a
free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background:
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on
reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics
and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC,
February 1999, states as follows:
"Where Are OFCs Located?
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction
anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest
OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote
areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more "remote" are mere
figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek
(sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in
intent and practice." [note: OFC =3D Offshore Financial Center]
Response:
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the
Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble
citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible
categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of
EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an
unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His
Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs
thereof.
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt
to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics
trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels,
terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without
even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate
such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least.
This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United
States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His
Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or
directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the
degrees of contravention.
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the
United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along
with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the
United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of
power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United
States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional
representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to
Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised
of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in
kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of
Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of "ethnic
cleansing" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:
Subject: A "State of War" Declaration
The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of
interests exists between it and the United States Government.=C2=A0 The
United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism,
appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in
"taking possession" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State,
which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.=C2=A0 The
explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by
agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments
of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many
Marshallese.=C2=A0 Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and
outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not
healed.
Thus a current state of adversity exists.=C2=A0 Following four years of
attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the
Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to
Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese
King, issued the "'State of War', a Declaration" and broadcast it to the
world.=C2=A0 The people were displaced from their native lands and kept
as
virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue
of being kept out.=C2=A0 It was through this pragmatic initiative that
the
Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon
the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the
ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios.
In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.=C2=A0
While a
state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past
wrongs remains on the horizon.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of EnenKio does not
condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or
agent of any government.=C2=A0 Such unnecessary means would diminish any
hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the
cause of peace within the family of nations.=C2=A0 The Kingdom of
EnenKio
also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of
the Marshallese people.
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the
U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter,
conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination,
preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses,
it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the
people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.=C2=A0 The refusal
of
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple
discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with
representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity,
turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of
the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute
the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.=C2=A0 Your
understanding is appreciated.=C2=A0

December 19, 1998: News Release
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the
occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio,
His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts
are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999.
Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made
his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of
traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a
family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved.
Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as
Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and
High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as
our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to
be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a
successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be
announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head
of State.
HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as
Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the
Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first
discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a
well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by
force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western
ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and
beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally
occupied by the federal government of the United States.
In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios
clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in
interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio
Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the
Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of
the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official
Internet site.
On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely
grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and
are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be
recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people
by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese
domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has
passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese
ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the
mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best
wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to
all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: Communiqu=C3=A9 to Correspondents
Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have
been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands
government warning against "fraudulent claims". We have once more
admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for
disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased
report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding
the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are
cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or
concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the
State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply:
The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No
claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any
claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in
the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the
ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual "state of
war" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as
an honorable state among nations.
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) "asserting
authority over land ...within the geographical and political
boundaries..." of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed
imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of
Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish
there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one
has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue
be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous
weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our
shirtsleeves, our raison d'=C3=AAtre is clearly mandated in the Preamble
to
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site:
http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled
"Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand," of May 1st, the editor was
advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver
licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of
EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary,
our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so
steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are
advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such
an act is patently illegal.
The published statement, "The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap
Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...", is wholly false. I
have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and
ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the
statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its
territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to
their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not "created" by
Robert Moore and he is not a "Honolulu-based attorney."
HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the
northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of
his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens
who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and
peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. "Enenkio" [sic]
(actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is
the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300
miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. "Wake" is a fictitious moniker
applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society
writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning
of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the
First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first
pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the
Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997.
First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official "First
Day of Issue" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time
following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are
encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint
mailing list.
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the
government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution
in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the
island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of
the Kingdom lingers in "exile". Several nations have extended
recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship
are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA
and elsewhere.
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake
Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned
names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people
in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the
atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant
jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and
cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the
government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial
title to "Wake" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at
the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar
fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful
return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by
Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the
Monarchy.
"STATE OF WAR" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to
top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a
virtual "state of war" now exists over the islands on account of the
blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from
United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to
request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related
factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific
Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the
atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom
have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal
advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events
and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the
world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights
violations by federal agents of the United States government.
INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and
dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium
nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the
basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets
varies according to the value and stability of national currency units,
the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with
any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the
stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be
determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are
printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended
for use as money.
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people
from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of
EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In
doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the "state of war" with the
federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with
human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from
the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom
and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top
Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the
United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts
that: "A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF
ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES." This is the most
recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One
of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a
Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding
the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United
States.
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of
disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the
government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with
similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the
premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and
compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal
action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal
government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal
announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and
failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world
regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by
the United States.
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three
small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by "Western explorers" for
Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue
is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land
tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal
chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United
States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in
1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple
landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war
missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of
the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a
cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the
East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was
destined to become a military installation.
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President
by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of
correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without
establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the
first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood
from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that
jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not
establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA
(predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base
for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called
annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently
illegal and its "ownership" is held therefore to be wholly invalid.
When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally
significant land to the "natives" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent
was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake
Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak
chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of
Micronesians living in the more "hospitable" islands of the Marshall
group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was,
the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at
Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby
activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or
quintessential knowledge by the American public.
Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian
Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there
being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel
Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in
sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder
of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title.
The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from
aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its
Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures
the rights of ownership.
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the
administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration,
"yields to the recognition that a State of War" exists over the island
nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or
unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom,
over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that
truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of
power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the
record of U.S. "ownership" and occupation. Native North Americans are
all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it
comes to seizure of land and denial of rights.
In the Declaration, demands are made as follows:
=C2=BB =C2=BB "...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an
honorable
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...".
=C2=BB =C2=BB "If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to
submit to
Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR
reparations to citizens."
=C2=BB =C2=BB "...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone..."
=C2=BB =C2=BB "...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in
commerce by failure the Department of the Interior
=C2=BB =C2=BB "...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more
than
TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a
Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is
obligated to pay."
=C2=BB =C2=BB That the "...Congress of the United States is obliged to
immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating
the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights
and due process...".
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable
nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the
Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a
peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of
the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly.
Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll,
titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern
atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall
Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe!
The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you
to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to
take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take
appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as
you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy
insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the
federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your
anonymity and that of your publication is well served.
Summary of Events 1993-94:
Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment
of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as
Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two
announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii
said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu
newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island
airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another
military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994;
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama
issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch
program out of Wake Island; part of the "star wars" program, I am led to
believe.
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was
held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under
the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of
independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as
king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the
first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake
I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called "no significant
impact" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature
into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its
sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership
claims.
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the
nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His
Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr.
Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution,
Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted.
On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into
law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the
USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the
people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent
peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as
owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and
embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of
democratic government.
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world
proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were
presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation
requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United
Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others.
Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request
for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council.
On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent
via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding
the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the
islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued
disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms
of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall
Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged
receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now
in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million.
The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994,
relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent,
only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands
Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then
only briefly.
Request for Media Response:
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural
calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and
deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a
new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an
aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth
of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about
suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the
security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of
"world leadership"? Or is it world domination?
People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an
effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby,
hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of
their ancestral heritage:
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed
invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper
annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized
by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for
at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and
validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a
fabrication.)
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of
specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack
thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my
understanding Wake was "decommissioned" after the so-called "processing"
of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s).
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war,
technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds
against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop
serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind.
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the
king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the
citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their
government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and
fiscal manner.
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of
questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation,
offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research,
environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note:
Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island
and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets
and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less
publicized projects.)
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with
regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by
King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored
and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human
rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and
conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal
to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military
and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology
for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year
and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious
significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio
citizens.)
Parting Shot:
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in
general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow
behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the
right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest
inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an
approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner
of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright
alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent
trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports,
forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and
virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have
escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government.
Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable
thirst of western "civilized" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry
of "manifest destiny" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a
century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only
be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of
American attempts at "fixing up the world". The title of ownership and
inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States
by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures
and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from
matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in
determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to
know; the media a responsibility to show them.
In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is
one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political
philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives
for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human
cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual
rights.
Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and
forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands
which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty,
King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister
Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of
Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials
in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing
came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the
illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by
the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899.
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value
and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common
Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King
Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S.
claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human
rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also
establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to
answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand
valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was
made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land.
Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per
month through 1995.
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S.
officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which
keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory
exile.
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a
small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands,
including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal
chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for
religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC.
During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and
explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the
real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the
islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who
recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill
Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian
Monarchy.
King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the
Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll.
Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the
islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of
restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most
recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air
Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii.
Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu
Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: "Air
Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island" and stated: "Not much
activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control".
According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private
entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a
stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral
heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people.
Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation
under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate
and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to
direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as
a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive
Council.
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the
effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any
substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers
and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the
recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the
lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios:
=C2=BB =C2=BB Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al
Gore
in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in
their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were
ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was "decommissioned" more
than a decade ago.
=C2=BB =C2=BB In response to the Environmental Assessment of the
proposed
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of
protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated
launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into
the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered.
=C2=BB =C2=BB Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket
launch
activities and requesting help went unanswered.
=C2=BB =C2=BB A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which
declared the
status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the
administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise
ignored.
After waiting for more than 580 days since "formal" notification of the
declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United
States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council.
They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied
access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of
Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the
Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government
recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his
family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio .
While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of
foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included
agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of
Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the
past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the
future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace.
Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the
United States.
Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S.
Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President
Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall
Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges
superiority of all Marshallese "natural" rights, including those of
ownership and use of land.
Still mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military
might and the willingness to use it against even the smallest of nations
(e.g. Grenada, Haiti, Cuba, Hawaii, etc., etc.), Mr. Moore, other
Ministers and the citizens of EnenKio are determined to peacefully
displace the U.S. Occupation Forces and reassert the jurisdiction of His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios. Filing the Commercial Affidavit document
was the first major legal step in a series of actions that could end up
in International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
In an effort to garner support for the repatriation of her citizens, the
restoration of democratic control of EnenKio and to gain international
recognition of the innumerable native rights violations against the
Sovereign and his forebears, the Ministers of EnenKio have sent
documents of Notice and request for assistance to the United Nations
Security Council, the South Pacific Commission, similar organizations
and to the governments of most other nations of the world.
It is hoped that mutual recognition of sovereignty and the establishment
of diplomatic ties will invite the willful withdrawal of U.S. troops and
relinquishment of their unfounded territorial claims. At the same time,
Mr. Moore, in the service of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, wishes to
inform all of the people being held at Wake Island by force of arms or
by contract, that asylum will be offered to them. A similar offer is
made to all Marshallese descendants who desire to become citizens of
EnenKio.
