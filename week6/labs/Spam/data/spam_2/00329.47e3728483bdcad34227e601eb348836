Creamfields. It's What August Bank Holidays Are for.  

Creamfields is the most intense, chilled out, full on, laid back experience you can cram into one day.  Creamfields is the only award-winning dance festival. It's the only festival to feature the best live acts on an outdoor stage, leaving the arenas to the DJs. Creamfields is the best of Cream, Bugged Out!, Global Underground, Subliminal, Passion, Pacha Futura, Frantic, Nukleuz, Bacardi B Bar and Sunday Best. It Just Gets Better.

To help get the party started (right), Ticketmaster have negotiated an exclusive offer of £5.00 off the normal price of tickets making the tickets just £41.00 plus booking fee.

Book here NOW. This offer is only available until 22 June*
