discoveries in herbal medicine have made it possible for men to
safely and effectively boost their sexual vitality while increasing
their penis size by 25% or more!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2">Certified Natural Laboratories is pleased to introduce the
latest addition to their widely acclaimed line of herbal
supplements: <i><b>Maxaman&#8482;.</b></i></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
size="2">Specially formulated with herbs and extracts from around
the globe, Maxaman&#8482; can help to enhance sexual sensitivity,
increase sexual stamina, and actually increase the size of your
penis by up to 25%. The special blend of herbs in Maxaman&#8482;
have been shown to boost blood flow to the penis, thus expanding
the sponge-like erectile tissue in the penis, leading to size gains
in both length and thickness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A
recent survey showed that 68% of women are unsatisfied with the
size of their partners. Of course most of these women would never
tell their partner that they are unhappy with their penis size.
Having a small or average-sized penis can result in depression and
feelings of inadequacy. Thankfully, men of all ages can now safely
and naturally increase the size of their penis and renew sexual
vitality without resorting to dangerous surgery.</font></p>

width="231" height="165" /><b><i>How to measure your penis size
correctly:</i></b> To determine length, measure the erect penis
from the base of the penis where the top of the shaft meets the
pubic area (the peno-pubic junction) to the tip of the head. For
uncircumcised men the foreskin should be retracted. To determine
width, measure at mid-shaft around the circumference while the
penis is erect.</font></p>

Whether you have a small, average or large penis, it is now
possible for you to increase the size of your penis by up to 25%
