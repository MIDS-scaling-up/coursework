YOU CAN MAKE A SEA OF DIFFERENCE

The non-profit Foundation for the Advancement of Marine Sciences (FAMS)
is dedicated to educating children and teaching teachers about the diverse
aspects of marine life, marine activities and how the marine environment
affects essentially all life on Earth.

FAMS offers hands-on, interactive marine science educational programs
designed to foster critical thinking about the complex yet delicate systems
that make up the Earth’s oceans.

FAMS has developed a funding program for Biology instructors so they can
assist students in raising money to attend the camp, and in raising funds
so the instructor can travel free to the camp.

WE HOPE YOU SHARE FAMS VISION BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR HELP.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

Get involved and show your support for FAMS. As a not-for-profit entity,
