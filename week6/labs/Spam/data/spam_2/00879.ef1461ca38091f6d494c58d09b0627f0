    Interview with Naomi Hancock, PR Manager, Veuve Clicquot UK - July 10=

2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------=20
=20
  On the occasion of the Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo in West Sussex,=20
Naomi Hancock reveals Veuve Clicquot's communication strategy.=20
=20
Veuve Clicquot has had a single consistent communication strategy in the=20
UK for the last 15 years. This has been to associate the brand with the=20
most glamorous sporting cultural and social events of the English summer =
-=20
known locally as The English Season.=20

Veuve Clicquot has become the Champagne of the Season. We've adapted our=20
communication to stay at the forefront of fashion, and attitudes to these=
=20
events, which combine tradition with the excitement of world class sport.=
=20


  Does your company consider sponsorship a key marketing/communication=20
tool?

Absolutely. Sponsorship enables us to build positive associations for the=
=20
brand. But we are not interested in tacking our name onto an event where=20
the addition does not add real value to the event and vica-versa. We=20
believe in investing, nurturing, and improving over time.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship strategy?

We aim to maximise the perception of Veuve Clicquot as the Champagne of=20
the Season. Everything we do is designed to build a partnership, and=20
enhance the valuable efforts of our partners, in their own creation, and=20
development of their events. Our buzz word is integration, as we seek to=20
make The Season central to our marketing mix.=20


  Can you describe your sponsorship decision-making process?

We usually discuss a sponsorship programme for the full year with our=20
mother company in France. We have flexibility - within our budget and the=
=20
frame of The Season - to undertake what we sense to match our values and=20
the image of Veuve Clicquot. Our role in London is to screen whatever=20
comes to us and discuss relevant operations internally.

We have a dedicated PR Group at Veuve Clicquot which makes all decisions=20
related to our sponsorship. Above a certain threshold our head-office wil=
l=20
like to be involved in such a decision.=20


  What are the main criteria on which you base your sponsorship strategy?

Return on investment is the key criterion for any marketing investment=20
decision. We would only undertake sponsorship in Season-related events.=20
This is our rule and frame of investment.


  What objectives are you seeking to achieve through sponsorship?

Within the Season, we are especially looking to achieve visibility vis-=E0=
-
vis our audience, image-transfer, media coverage (all national press,=20
magazine of all kinds).=20

Awareness is also key for Veuve Clicquot, so we look to find events that=20
complement those that we already have, and extend our appeal to people of=
=20
similar status, but differing interests.=20


  Please describe one of your sponsorships

The Eighth Annual Veuve Clicquot Gold Cup Polo, held this month at Cowdra=
y=20
Park in West Sussex, is the largest entertainment operation undertaken by=
=20
Veuve Clicquot UK each year. This successful sponsorship earns Veuve=20
Clicquot tremendous media coverage, fabulous exposure to our core target=20
group and a perfect image transfer as polo is the sports of kings and the=
=20
king of sports.


  What's your approximate sponsorship spend per year?

Significant. Without giving figures, we can say that we spend a large=20
portion of our communication in sponsorship and support and that we=20
organize the majority of our communication around the theme of Veuve=20
Clicquot as the Champagne of the Season, because this is where we are=20
getting a good return on our investment.


  How do you measure the effectiveness of your sponsorship?
