Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier

This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.


1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.

3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.

4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.

6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.

7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.

8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.

9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.

10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)

 ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~

yes   81%
no    19%

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  

We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  

The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 

Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

<br>~~~~~~~~~
<p>No. This is a funny thing to me.&nbsp; I hear about so many
<br>people being super scared to give out their SS#.&nbsp; Well folks,
<br>I can get your SS# for 50 cents.&nbsp; Give me a name and address
<br>and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
<p>We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
<br>the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
<br>they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They could do
<br>who knows what with the CC number.&nbsp; I once had a person
<br>tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
<br>of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
<br>person (me) would have her account info and could write
<br>a check out for thousands of dollars.&nbsp; I told her to just send
<br>it to me then and she said that was OK.&nbsp; Then I asked her
<br>to tell me what the difference was between the original check
<br>and a fax copy.&nbsp; I told her to ask her lawyer that too.&nbsp;
Never
<br>heard back from her.
<p>The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
<br>available in many places.&nbsp; Have a good day.

<p>Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
<br>we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
<br>importantly, never give any personal information at a site
<br>that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
<br>or a Veri secure sign or others.
<p>Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
<br>in my credit information in each time instead of having
<br>an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
<br>involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
<br>mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
<br>deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
<br>to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

<p>Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
<br>my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
<br>was in a bad car accident.&nbsp; I had a full service account.
<br>My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
<br>went unprotected.&nbsp; A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
<br>and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
<br>address to a porn shop.&nbsp; Thus, I lost 4 years of building
<br>up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
<br>on 8 more.&nbsp; This set me back about 4&nbsp; months: I believe I
<br>lost a minimum of $50,000.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.&nbsp; The first
<br>time I lost almost 4 months of work.&nbsp; Now, I back up often
<br>enough to not to lose so much time.&nbsp; This is also Internet
<br>theft.&nbsp; These people are nothing but out and out criminals
<br>and should spend years behind bars.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
<br>however, merchants can lose a lot of money.&nbsp; I sell only by
<br>purchase order and certified or registered company checks.
