Email marketing - if done right - is both highly effective and amazingly cost effective.  OK, it can be 
downright PROFITABLE.  If done right.

Imagine sending your sales letter to one million, two million, ten million or more prospects during 
the night.  Then waking up to sales orders, ringing phones, and an inbox full of freshly qualified 
leads.
